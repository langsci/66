Secondly the usefulness or otherwise of answering the first question  is examined. The third question specifically addresses whether or  not a Western Malayo-Polynesian language of Northern Sumatra, Karo  Batak, is typologically ergative-like or whether the construction  type that might be interpreted as ergative is in fact a passive.1  },

@inbook{Klaiman1988Affectedness,
	abstract = {1.1. Voice and voice systems: basicness and some basic concepts p.  26[{\ldots}]For several years, many linguists have been interested  in the typology of case and case systems including, for example,  the comparative properties of ergative-absolutive and nominative-accusative  systems. These two types of system differ from one another according  to the patterns by which case is assigned to the core (essential)  arguments of transitive and intransitive sentences (these arguments  being subject and object for transitive, subject alone for intransitives).  Both types of system commonly embody devices for reorganizing the  assignment of core grammatical relations to particular thematic roles  (or to the arguments bearing these roles) . For instance, the name  `passive' is applied to a device of this variety commonly found in  accusative languages; `antipassive' is considered the counterpart  to passive in ergative case systems. Such devices relate classes  of sentences and are often viewed as derivational processes. The  basis for their existence varies from language to language; in some  systems (`role-dominated' languages in the parlance of Foley and  Van Valin, 1984) their motivation is syntactic/semantic; in others  (Foley and Van Valin's `reference-dominated' systems) their motivation  is attributed to discourse and pragmatic factors. In many languages,  of course, syntactic and discourse factors both playa role in processes  of this sort. Whatever their motivation, these devices are usually  regarded as rearranging the basic syntactic organization of a sentence,  i.e., as interchanging the grammatical relations of arguments representing  certain roles. In accusative languages, as mentioned above, certain  processes which have this effect are said to represent `passivization'.  What happens under passivization is usually viewed in one of two  ways.In the simplest scheme, Agent is the role normally borne by  grammatical subjects in nonderived sentences (Keenan, 1976b); sentences  which have agentive subjects are said to be in the active voice';  and ``sentences in nonactive voices ... are to be derived by promoting  to subject (position) various non-subject constituents of active  sentences {\ldots} .'' (Keenan, 1976a:255). Grammatical voice, according  to this view, is a system for moving arguments `representing nonagential  thematic relations into subject position. A limitation of this analysis  is, of course, that few (if any) languages restrict subjects of nonderived  sentences to the Agent role.Rather than treating Agent as a role  basic to subject, a more sophisticated approach to sentence derivation  might be taken by viewing Agent as the prototypical subject thematic  role. Suppose one has a scheme under which verbs (or verbal concepts)  are grouped into several well defined semantic classes. (For examples  of such schemata see Dik, 1980:53; and see Foley and Van Valin, 1984:40ff.,  who use a classification scheme attributed to Dowty and Vendler.)  If one adopts some such scheme, a different thematic role can be  ascribed to basic subjects for each verb class. Agent then furnishes  the prototype of `basic subject'; i.e., as Agent is the role basic  to subject in verb class A, so another thematic role is basic to  subject in *class B, and so on. (One can simplify the scheme by taking  all the roles basic to the subjects of the different verb classes  and assigning them to a single macrocategory, such as Foley and Van  Valin's `actor' macroroles.) Then the passive can be seen essentially  as a process for moving thematic arguments in and out of sentential  subject position. In other words, passive relates two classes of  sentences: one class in which the thematic role borne by the subject  corresponds to the Agent prototype; and another class of sentences  in which the thematic role borne by the subject does not. Once processes  like passive (and their counterparts in nonaccusative systems) are  defined in this way, one can proceed to working out their expressive,  pragmatic and syntactic functions. Much recent research in theoretical  grammar has been taken up with these issues. The present essay, however,  is principally concerned with the typology of subject's relation  to sententially expressed situations in basic, not derived, sentences.  In various languages, subjects of nonderived sentences seem to be  permitted to have either of two conceptual statuses. I shall refer  to these statuses in the present essay as `controller' and `affected  entity', Again, in various languages, a formal alternation in verbal  morphology indicate which of the two statuses is borne by the sentential  subject. In this essay, I all refer to such alternate forms as diathesis,  and the system to which they pertain I shall refer to as voice.The  notions Controller and affected entity might be clarified by a comparison  with the concepts actor and undergoer introduced by Foley and Van  Valin, 1984. It has been observed that Foley and Van Valin define  actor as a macrorole, i.e., as a concept superordinate to relations  like Agent, Instrument, Goal and so forth. Thus the italicized items  in (1a-e) below are classified as actors (p. 30), although each represents  a distinct thematic relation. Analogously, Foley and Van Valin suggest  that there is a macrorole which furnishes the prototype of basic  object, namely the undergoer macrorole; thus they (ibid.) classify  each italicized role in (2a-e) below as an undergoer. [{\ldots}]In  the present essay I shall use the undergoer macrorole notion of Foley  and Van Valin, but a concept `affected entity' is to be introduced  as well. It is distinct from undergoer, since affected entity is  not a thematic relation; rather, it is a conceptual status (like  `controller', which will be considered shortly). Affected entity  status can accrue to arguments representing various thematic relations,  and in fact it can converge with either macrorole posited by Foley  and Van Valin, actor or undergoer, upon a single sentential argument.  This will be clarified in the body of the essay.In the essay I also  refer to `controller', a conceptual status distinct from the macrothematic  concept actor. The latter will be more often referred to below by  the term `source', indicating the argument to whose participation  onces can attribute the eventuality represented in a sentence --  i.e., that argument in whose absence killing would not have taken  place in (1a), shattering in (1b), receiving in (1e), sensing in  (1d), emitting in (1e), throwing in (2a) and so on. I agree with  Foley and Van Valin's positing some such macrorole, but dissent from  their attributing the conceptual status `controller' to the actor  (source) macrorole exclusively. That is, the principal difference  between my scheme and Foley and van Valin's lies in the absolute  distinction they draw between actors and undergoers; the two macroroles  cannot converge upon a single argument in the same sentence. For  instance, Foley and Van Valin identify the underlined argument in  (1d) above as an actor; it cannot also represent an undergoer. However,  according to the scheme of this essay, the argument in question is  both an actor (or source) and an affected entity.By affected entity  is meant the participant perceived as affected or most affected in  consequence of the sententially denoted action (= situation). An  affected entity may undergo action but need not do so; in some languages,  as we will see, an entity can be perceived as affected in virtue  of performing, not undergoing, certain actions. Conversely, while  controller conceptual status is ordinarily associated with actors,  it may accrue to undergoers in some systems (see Section 4 below).  By way of a working definition, controller status can be ascribed  to the argument whose participation is seen as determining the course  and/or outcome of a sententially denoted action. A later part of  this essay, Section 5, is devoted to discussing further the definition  and universal /particular manifestations of the conceptual status  of controller. Overall, the essay will show that not only do conceptual  statuses (controller, affected entity) and particular thematic/macrothematic  relations sometimes converge, but that conditions and constraints  on their convergence define a typology of voice systems.p. 291.2.  Scope of the study As stated above, this essay is not principally  coned with processes like passive and antipassive. The effects of  these processes are often signalled in verbal morphology by derivational  markers, and are sometimes accounted for in terms of sentence-deriving  rules. This is why these processes are referred to in the present  essay by the term `derived voice'. However, no prejudice is intended  to analyses in which passives, antipassives, etc., are base-generated,  or otherwise not accounted for by some formal process operating on  `basic' syntactic/semantic structures (see fn. 2). `Derived voice'  is simply intended here to mean processes, like passive and antipassive,  that can be analyzed in terms of sentence derivation (whether the  individual analyst chooses to do so or not is beside the point) .  In applying the term `voice' to such processes, it is easy for the  analyst to overlook the fact that the same term usually refers to  a very different class of phenomena in traditional grammar. In fact,  the use of the term `voice' in reference to sentence-deriving processes  (i.e., regular formal relationships among classes of sentences) is  a fairly recent innovation. A traditional grammarian, Jespersen,  1965:164ff., has presented a detailed discussion of the relation  of active and passive constructions in {English} while explicitly  maintaining that this relation is not one of `voice'. Rather, he  treats active and passive as formally related sentence types, in  contrast to voice oppositions as found in classical languages, e.g.,  active and middle in Greek and Sanskrit ([{\ldots}]). In the present  essay, to distinguish active/middle and similar systems from `derived  voice', the term `basic voice' is introduced. This term denotes a  type of relation encoded in verbal morphology (i.e., through diathesis),  signalling which of several alternative conceptual statuses is borne  by the sentential subject. Basic voice oppositions are not analyzable  in derivational terms (i.e., in terms of a rule for relating one  class of sentences to another). [{\ldots}][{\ldots}]p. 30It seems  to me that the goal of a better understanding of the relations between  basic voice systems and derived voice processes is a worthy starting  point for a general program of research. The present essay is intended  to contribute to the research program in two principal ways: (i)  by offering an account of several different voice systems within  a single descriptive framework; (ii) by proposing a rudimentary scheme  of typological classification for basic voice systems (Section 6).  In addition, Section 5 offers some speculations on how voice systems  may relate to a variety of other mechanisms for encoding a particular  semantic function, the expression of control (a parameter whose significance  will be increasingly apparent in Sections 2-4 below). [{\ldots}]As  hinted in Section 1.1. above, a major claim of this essay is that  the conceptual status of sentential arguments plays a role in the  organization of (basic) voice systems. A good starting point for  justifying this claim might be in noting that the concept of voice  is often explained in exactly this way in traditional grammars, particularly  in descriptions of classical Indo-European languages. Many of these  descriptions more or less explicitly treat diathesis (verbal voice  marking) as a means of encoding a distinction in views of sententially  denoted action, a distinction having to do with the subject referent's  conceptual status -- its perceived relationship to the action's effects.  Lyons, 1968:363, summarizing the respective functions of active and  middle (mediopassive) voice in Latin, Greek, and other classical  Indo-European languages, alludes to this distinction. He remarks  that, whereas the active verb expresses a view of the subject as  an Agent or doer of the sententially denoted action, the use of middle  voice is to mark situations in which ``the `action' or `state' affects  the subject of the verb or his interests.'' (emphasis added) The  following section presents some illustrations of middle voice functions  in two classical languages. This will be a useful preliminary to  our later survey of other languages, some of which have not been  traditionally thought of as voice-embodying languages. p. 312. VOICE  FUNCTIONS IN CLASSICAL INDO-EUROPEAN 2.1. Classical Greek In classical  Greek most conjugations of the verb require the marking of the active/middle  distinction. A typical function of the middle in Greek is to indicate  an identity relation between the subject (or more properly, the source  argument) and the direct object (or more properly, the undergoer).  That is, a middle voice verb may convey reflexive or reciprocal activity.  Examples, (3a-c) below (from Barber, 1975) illustrate this function.  Another middle voice function, referred to by Barber as the ``plain  middle'', is that of showing the subject's beneficiary status vis-{\`a}-vis  the action; i.e., for conveying the subject's dual status, as source  (performer) of the action and as affected entity, or locus of the  action's effects. Illustrations (again, from Barber) are provided  in (4-5).[{\ldots}]p. 32Several additional functions of Greek middle  voice are outlined by Smyth (1974). One of these (for which an appropriate  designation might be `nucleonic middle') involves the expression  of action in which the undergoer can be seen as, in some way, within  the ``sphere'' (Smyth's terminology) of the Subject. Thus the middle  is used when the undergoer, is the property of -- or belongs to --  the Subject (`wash one's hands', `give one's vote'); when the undergoer  moves into the sphere of the Subject (`to send for a thing'); or  when' the undergoer moves out of the sphere of --the Subject (`sell',  i.e., `give a thing for one's `profit'; `deliver a speech'). Another  typical use of Greek middle voice is for expressing the disposition  of the Subject. In other words, there is a preference for middle  diathesis when effects logically accrue to no party but the Subject.  This function is especially typical of deponent. Middle verbs (Smyth,  p.. 393). Some of these verbs denote bodily or physical disposition,  i.e., `jump', `fly', `dance', etc.; others denote emotive or mental  disposition, i.e., `perceive', `wish', `consider', `lament', etc.  Apart from the deponent (disposition-expressing) function, middle  voice generally seems to be selected over active in Greek where the  action's effects, good or ii, accrue to the Subject; thus middle  is the typical diathesis of verbs such as `marry', `make peace',  etc.According to Smyth (ibid., p. 390) the middle voice in Greek  indicates broadly that the action is performed with `special reference'  to the subject. The various middle voice functions outlined above  suggest that this special reference involves an identity between  the source of action and the entity principally affected thereby.  There is, though, one further function of middle diathesis in Greek  and in lE generally (the `passive' middle function). Discussion of  which will be deferred to the end of the following outline of voice  in classical Sanskrit. p. 332.2. Classical Sanskrit Traditional Sanskrit  grammars use the terms {\=a}tmane-pada and parasmaipada, respectively,  to refer to middle and active diathesis. The terms {\=a}tmane and  parasmai literally mean `for oneself' and `for another', while pada  means `term' or `word'. Evidently, then, the early Sanskrit grammarians  conceived of diathesis as the marking of a conceptual distinction  between actions whose effects bear principally on their sources,  and actions whose effects bear principally on arguments other than  their sources. Commentary on the functions of the two diatheses in  the early Sanskrit grammar attributed to P{\=a}{\d n}ini tends to  confirm this. It also reveals the close similarity of verbal voice  functions in Sanskrit to those of classical Greek. [{\ldots}]p. 716.  THE TYPOLOGY OF VOICE: CONCLUSIONS Processes of subject derivation,  or derived voice, have been distinguished in this essay from voice  alternations in nonderived sentences, or basic voice. Basic voice  has been seen as a system for marking identity or non-identity of  the sentential subject with the conceptual status of affected entity.  The distinction is encoded on sentential verbs through nonderivational  morphological alternations in verbal bases; i.e., diathesis. p. 72Affected  entity is neither a grammatical nor a thematic relation; it is a  conceptual status which may be assigned to arguments representing  certain thematic roles. Specifically, affected entity status may  devolve upon either of the essential or core arguments of transitive  sentence structures, source (actor) or undergoer. Affected entity  is closely related to another conceptual status, that of control,  i.e., locus of control over sententially denoted action. The determination  of controller is highly viable cross-linguistically, although it  frequently plays a role in basic subject selection (sometimes in  combination with the actor macrorole). But however controller is  defined , and however it functions in any particular system, it is  hypothesized that affected entity will be defined in that system  in terms of the notion control. That is, affected entity in any system  represents the locus of maximum effective or potential control over  verbally denoted action. This testable hypothesis is the major result  of the present investigation and is intended as a foundation hypothesis  for future research on voice systems and their typology. From this  hypothesis it follows that affected entities in any basic voice system  will have just the semantic properties associated with controllers.  Therefore, affected entity, will converge or not with the macrorole  notion actor (source) just to the degree that controller status tends  to converge with Source in the particular system. Among the languages  surveyed in this essay, for instance, Tamil shows a strong tendency  for basic subject to represent the convergence of source thematic  role and controller status; likewise, affected entity status accrues  only to source-subjects in Tamil basic sentences. At the other extreme,  Korean and Navajo show little if any tendency for source and controller  to converge on any one grammatical relation in sentence structures.  Rather, controller status combines with either of the core thematic  relations in transitive structures to create the either of the core  thematic relations in transitive structures to create the sentential  subject; and affected entity status, too, can devolve upon either  of those two thematic relations in subject position.It seems, then,  that an illuminating typological schema for voice systems can be  constructed upon a scale, of core thematic relation-affected entity  identities. This is shown in (52) below, which places the major languages  surveyed in this paper in an ordered ranking according to a scale  of affected entity-macrorole identities:p. 73Among the languages  surveyed in the essay it is close to9 the X-extreme that one would  place Tamil, as a language in which affected entity invariably has  the thematic role of source (actor). Proceeding toward the Y-end  of the scale we next have classical lE systems. In these languages  there is a convergence of affected entity and source thematic role  much of the time, but not always; e.g., not in the catalytic and  passive functions of the affective (i.e., middle) voice. Closer to  the Y-end of the scale we find the next system, Korean. Only in relatively  rare instances (such as ex. 43 above) can undergoer and affected  entity be seen as not strictly coinciding in this language. At the  far Y-extreme of the scale, lastly, we have systems like Navajo,  in which, evidently, all affected subjects are also undergoers. It  deserves mention in closing that a hierarchical scale defined by  actor and undergoer at its two extremes, the Actor/Undergoer hierarchy,  is proposed by Foley and Van Valin, 1984:59. They do so in order  to explain cross-language tendencies for certain pragmatic and thematic  relations to converge in sentential functional structure. It may  be a tribute to the accuracy and elegance of the scale they set up  that it seems to find confirmation in the typology of voice systems.  },

	annote = {Partially contradictory e.g. 4.3. on Pivot) and not very clear at  some places, but contains a great deal of good examples.p. 117If  the passive is a typologically valid category, it must, like all  such categories, be identified in terms of the meaning or function  it shares across languages, and in terms of its formal marking in  individual lgs. (Palmer 1986: 2-7).It can be said that the basic  functions of the passive are the promotion of the Patient (or non-Agent)  and the demotion or deletion of the Agent (but see 6.7). This does  not involve the acceptance of a particular syntactic theory, but  merely implies that the functions of the roles of Agent, Patient  etc. in the passive can be accounted for in terms of variation from  their functions in the active sentence.It is the recognition that  the Agent is the Subject and the Patient is the Object in the active  sentence and that the active is the basic construction (see 3.1),  white the Patient (or non-Agent) is the Subject and the Agent has  peripheral status or is absent in the passive sentence, that makes  it possible to talk about the promotion of the Patient to Subject  and the demotion or deletion of the Agent. As already argued, the  passive must have some formal marking, and it seems generally true.  That there is marking on the verb. Haspelmath (1990: 267) argues  that the are no passive constructions without passive verbal morphology,  but, provided `verbal morphology' is used widely to include clitics,  this may be no more than a part of the definition of passive rather  than an empirical observation.p. 1195.2 Promotion of Object There  are some verbs in {English} that do not appear to have passives,  e.g. HAVE (in the sense of possession) and RESEMBLE. This is also  true of CONTAIN in a stative sense, but not in a dynamic sense. Equal1y,  verbs such as WEIGH May passivize when their `objects' refer to the  items weighed, but not to the measurement: One way of dealing with  this problem is to say that the NP after the verb is not an Object.  Apart from the lack of passivization, the arguments are Dot notional1y  patients, but locatives or terms of measurement (often called `adjuncts').However,  that is not an entirely valid argument, since, as will be seen in  5.3, promotion by passivization is not a test of `Object-hood'. It  might be more appropriate to recognize another type of (grammatical)  argument, which occupies the place of the Object with an active verb,  yet is (a) not affected by passivization, and (b) does not have the  notional role of patient. However, if availability for promotion  is taken to establish such NPs as o objects, there is considerable  variation in languages in respect of the notional roles of the NPs  that may function as Objects. Thus, in Arabic both temporal and locative  NPs are marked morphologically as Objects and can be promoted to  Subject by passivization (Davison 1980: 51-2):p. 121ln Kinyarwanda  (Bantu) all kinds of notional roles may be similarly identified as  Objects. Unlike their translational equivalents in {English}, the  verbs `have', `weigh' etc. an have passives; `have' is exemplified  in (Kimenyi 1980: 127f): Similar, but more surprising, perhaps are  the passives in (Kimenyi 1988: 361f):Umug{\'o}re a-rwaa-ye um{\'u}twe  Woman she-be.sick-ASP headache `The woman has a headache' Um{\'u}twe  u-rwaa-w-e n'{\^u}mug{\'o}re headache it-be.sick-PASS-ASP by woman  `It is the woman that bas a headache' Umug{\'o}re y-{\'a}-b{\'a}a-ye  perezida woman she-PST-be-ASP president `The woman became president'  Perezida y-a-baa-w-e n'{\^u}mug{\'o}represident he-PST-be-PASS-ASP  by woman `It is the woman who became president' Umugabo a-ra-geend-a  ijoro man he-PRS-travel-ASP night `The man is travelling in the night'Ijoro  ri-ra-geend-w-a n'{\^u}mugabo night it-PRS-travel-PASS-ASP by man  `Is the man who is travelling in the night'(Kimenyi does not explain  why he uses the translations beginning with `It is the woman/man  who{\ldots}'; the obvious implication is that the Agent is focused  by passivization.) He notes that `all semantic roles, patients, datives,  benefactives, manners, instrumentals, goals, locatives, temporals,  attributives . . . , function as direct objects'. Often a verb has  what seem to be two Objects (including the types just discussed)  and either may be promoted:Umugaanga a-ru-vuur-a umug{\'o}re ink{\^o}r{\'o}ra  doctor he-PRS-cure-ASP woman cough `The doctor is treating the woman's  cough' Umug{\'o}re a-ra-vuur-w-a {\'\i}nk{\^o}r{\'o}ra n'{\^u}mugaanga  woman she-PRS-cure-PASS-ASP cough by doctor `*The woman is being  treated the cough by the doctor' ink{\^o}r{\'o}ra i-ra-yuur-w-a umug{\'o}re  n'{\^u}mugaanga cough it-PRS-cure-PASS-ASP woman by doctor `*The  cough is being treated woman by the doctor' Treating these in terms  of constructions with two Objects entails the recognition of the  construction Subject + Object + Object as well as the usual tr. Subject+  Object. It might be claimed that these are not Objects but various  kinds of oblique relations. There are two arguments against this:  they are not formally distinguished from Objects `proper' in any  way, {\ldots} Kinyarwanda has oblique relations (Dative, Instrumental  and Locative) that are formally marked as such and can be also promoted  to Subject (but see 6.6.2).There is equally no evidence to suggest  that, when there are two Objects, they can be distinguished as primary  and secondary Objects (2.4, but see 6.6.2). Another language that  has a construction with two Objects, either of which may be promoted,  is Tigrinya (Ethiopian Semitic, personal research), but this occurs  only with the verb `give': There is another construction with two  Objects in Tigrinya, but only one of them may be promoted. This is  the construction in which the second Object indicates a part of the  body and the first is marked as animate. Only the Object marked as  animate may be promoted: (There is a similar construction in Korean  -- see 5.6.) Rather different are the passives in {English} exemplified  by (see Palmer 1987: 215ff.):The daughter looked after the old man  The old man was looked after by the daughterIn the active the old  man seems to be part of a prepositional phrase, but, obviously, look  after is treated as a single verb with the old man as its object.  Similar passives are possible with idioms such as do away with, get  rid off, put up with. But passivization is possible with some combinations  of verb plus preposition, even though there is no such idiomaticity:  This hat has been sat on.The bed has been slept in.Finally, it should  be noted that even if a lg bas a passive, not all Objects/Patients  can be promoted to Subject. Thus it was seen in 2.2 that in Korean  the passive Subject must be `in general, animate and conscious'.  Objects that do{\^A}{\textperiodcentered} not have these characteristics  cannot be promoted. p. 1255.3 Promotion of oblique terms Although  the Patient-Object is the tern most commonly promoted to Subject,  in some lgs terms other than Objects, oblique terms, may also be  promoted. The Beneficiary-Dative is often promoted (and it is relevant  to note that the Beneficiary was often the promoted term in the double  Object constructions of 5.2), An example from Japanese is (Song 1987:  75):{\ldots}Whether this is also true of {English} (as the translation  given above might suggest) is discussed in 6.6. More strikingly,  Malagasy has a passive voice, but also a `circumstantial' voice,  which promotes both the Beneficiary-Dative and the Instrumental.  Examples (Keenan 1972: 172- 3): The verb form indicates whether the  Subject is the Agent, the Patient or one of the oblique terms, and  the Subject appears in final position. The promoted Subjects (`the  rice', `the children', `the money') also have the syntactic characteristics  of Subjects in that they may function as pivots. They are used as  heads of relative clauses, and it may be recalled that in Malagasy  it is only Subjects that can be relativised:{\ldots} A very different  language that cao also promote either the Object or the Instrumental  is Kwakwala (Wakashan, British Columbia, Levine 1980: 241, Anderson  1985: 166). Examples are (the glosses are from Anderson, and notice  that the suffixes on the NPs indicate the relation of the following  NP):n{\'E}{\texttrademark}p'id-i-da g{\'E}{\texttrademark}nan{\'E}{\texttrademark}m-x{\`I}{\textsterling}a  guk{\^E}{\textperiodcentered}-sa t'is{\'E}{\texttrademark}mthrow-SUBJ-ART  child-OBJ house-INSTR rock `The child hit the house with a rock by  throwing' (`The child threw a rock at the house') n{\'E}{\texttrademark}p'id-su?-i-da  guk{\^E}{\textperiodcentered}-sa ganan-sa t'is{\'E}{\texttrademark}mthrow-SU?-SUBJ-ART  house-INSTR child-INSTR rock`The house was hit by a rock thrown by  the child' n{\'E}{\texttrademark}p'id-ayu-i-da t'is{\'E}{\texttrademark}m  xa guk{\^E}{\textperiodcentered}-sa g{\'E}{\texttrademark}nan{\'E}{\texttrademark}mthrow-ayu-SUBJ-ART  rock-OBJ house-INSTR child `The rock was what the child threw at  the hause' eThe rock was . used for throwing at the house by the  child')As with Malagasy, there are two different types of passive,  one for the promotion of the Object, the other for the promotion  of the oblique with markers -su?- and -ayu respectively. Levine,  in fact, argues against a passive interpretation in favour of one  in terms of `focus', but the constructions contain typical passive  features, although it is, indeed, the case that there is some similarity  between the systems of Malagasy and Kwakw'ala and those of `topic'  lgs to be discussed in 6.4. p. 1275.4 Impersonal and `affected' passives  In a number of languages there are passives of intransitive verbs;  examples from Latin, German and Dutch are: Es wurde im Nebenzimmer  geredet. It is almost certain, however, that this type of passive  is restricted to what might be called `agentive' verbs (see 3.5.4)  or what Perlmutter (1978) calls `unergative', where the single term  S is an agent, .as contrasted with `unaccusative', where S is essentially  a patient. Perlmutter and Postal (1984: 144) give an example from  Welsh with the verb `dance', but note that Welsh does Dot permit  the passivization of `grow': The simplest explanation for the fact  that generally it is agentive intransitive verbs that are passivized  may be round in Shibatani's suggestion (see the discussion in 6.7)  that the primary function of the passive is defocusing' :which includes  deletion) of the agent. Generally it is the Agent-Subject of transitives  that is demoted or deleted; with intransitives is similarly deleted  or demoted, but only if it is an agent.Alternatively, it might also  be noted that these agentive verbs have unexpressed `cognate' Objects  ('fight a flight, `dance a dance' etc), and that in {English}, one  can `have a fight / whistle/a dance / a swim', but not `*have a grow  / a drown'; notionally at least, these cognate objects might be considered  to be the unexpressed Subjects of the passives (`(A fight) was fought'  etc.); there is even some grammatical evidence for this in the constructions  with the impersonal (`it') Subject, which might suggest the promotion  of an unexpressed `it' (the cognate object) in the active.Impersonal  passives are also round with verbs that have a second argument that  is not marked as Object, but as an oblique term (the oblique term  is not promoted, as in the examples of 5.3). Thus in Latin INVIDEO  (`envy') is followed by the dative, not the accusative, but it has  a passive (with the dative NP unchanged): The same is true of German:seine  Freunde halfen ihm his friends helped him.DAT `His friends helped  him' Ihm wurde von seinen Freunden geholfen him.DAT became by bis  friends helped`He was helped by his friends.'{\ldots}There is a similar  situation in Icelandic, where some verbs are followed by le dative,  others by the genitive (Andrews 1982: 466-7):{\~A}{\textthreequarters}eir  bj{\"o}rgu{\~A}{\textdegree}u st{\'u}lkunni they rescued girl.DAT  `They rescued the girl' st{\'u}lkunni var bjarga{\~A}{\textdegree}  girl.DAT was rescued `The girl was rescued' vi{\~A}{\textdegree}  vitj{\~A}{\textdegree}um {\'O}lafs we visited Olaf.GEN `We visited  Olaf.'{\'O}lafs var vitja{\~A}{\textdegree}Olaf.GEN was visited `Olaf  was visited' Syntactically, the dative or genitive NP in the passive  may function as a pivot, and is thus `treated as another example  of `dative subject' (Andrews 1985: 122, but see the discussion in  4.3): M{\'e}r var hj{\'a}lpa{\~A}{\textdegree} I.DAT was helped `I  helped' min var vitja{\~A}{\textdegree} I.GEN was visited `I was  visited' {\'E}g vonast tH ao vera hj{\^a}lpao/vitjao 1 hope towards  to be helped/visited `1 hope to be helped' _ (But Andrews 1982: 467  says that the last sentence is 4questionable for many speakers' .)  . The issue is made more complex by the fact that, in sorne languages,  there appear to be impersonal passives of transitive verbs, in which  the Patient remains in the Object position and is not promoted to  Subject, e.g. in Irish (Keenan 1985: 275): Bhuail si e Hit she him  `She hit him' Buaileadh (lei) e Hit + IMPERS PASS (with ber) him  `She was hit by him' {\ldots}:i. Song notes that there is a similar  construction in Korean, but with a difference in that in the active  the possessor may be indicated either in the gentive or, apparently,  as a second Object (see 5.2): John-in ai-ii/IiI son-il jab-ossta  n-TOP Child-GENjACC hand-Acc catch-PAST John grasped the child's  band/the child by the band' Ai-nin John-ege son-il jab-hi-ossta Child-TOP  John-DAT hand-Acc catch-PASS-PAST Rhe child was subjected to John's  grasping his hand' (`The child's hand was held by John'?) Here it  might appear that the passive is derived by simply promoting the  second Object, but the first Object (`hand') cannot be similarly  promoted, so that it may be simpler to treat this in the same way  as the previous sentence, Le. As an adversity passive. 5.5 Passives  and topicalization It is wise to exclude change of word order alone  as a marker of the passive, even though word order is often the only  formaI distinction between Subject and Object (and in {English} it  is the most important feature, and the only one that is always present).  The reason for excluding word order is that in many lgs it is used,  independently of passivization, for the purpose of topicalization.  Thus, even in {English} an Object may be placed in initial position  for that purpose: This is not, however, restricted to Objects or  even to NPs: Intelligent, he is not.{\ldots}It May also be added  that in Greek and {English}, it does not acquire pivot status. There  are, however, marginal and debatable cases. For instance, it was  seen in 4.1.1 that in Lango it is the topicalized NP that controls  deletion in coordination, but this topicalization is not accompanied  by any markers on the verb, and it is the Subject that controls reflexives  (4.1.4). ln any case, as was argued in 4.3, pivots should not be  used as evidence for Subjects, and, a fortiorithey are not evidence  for passivization. Another example of a construction about which  there has been disagreement is to be found in Acehneset to be discussed  in 6.2. A little more problematic is the situation in Kinyarwanda  (Bantu, Kimenyi 1988: 357-8).This language has passives (discussed  in 5.2 and 5.3), but it also has a device for interchanging Subject  and Object, but with the additional point that the Object, when moved  into Subject position, is the argument that agrees with the verb:  abag{\'o}re ba-a-ri b{\^a}-teet-se ib{\'\i}shy{\'\i}imbo women they-PST-be  they-cook-ASP beans `The women were cooking beans' (Kimenyi 1988:  358)object-subject reversal:ib{\'\i}shy{\'\i}imbo by-aa-ri b{\^\i}-teet-se  abag{\'o}re beans they-PST-be they-cook-ASP women `The beans were  being cooked by the women.' (Kimenyi 1988: 358)Agreement with the  verb is shown by the prefixes glossed by Kimenyi as `they'; in the  first sentence they are appropriate to the class that includes `woman',  in the second, to the class that includes `beans'. Kimenyi translates  the second as if it were passive, rather than as `The beans, the  women cooked', but it is better treated as a topicalization device  rather than a passive, not only because Kinyarwanda has a quite different  passive, but, more irnportantly, because there is, again, no passive  marker on the verb. It was noted in 2.6 for Chichewa, another Bantu  lg, that even locatives may be placed in initial position and agree  with the verb. Although agreement marking of topicalized arguments  is typologically unusual, these sentences in Kinyarwanda are better  treated as examples of topicalization than of passivization. Alternatively,  perhaps, an absolute distinction between passivization and topicalization  should not be drawn; these constructions of Kinyarwanda have one  of the marks of the passive, but lack the more crucial passive marking  on the verb.Another problematic case is provided by Palauan (W. Austronesian,  Foley and Van Valin 1985: 316-17). Here what appears to be a passive  involves interchange of the positions of Agent and Patient and a  set of special prefixes on the verb that agree with the passive Agent.  (There is agreement with the Patient in both active and passive,  but not, apparently with the agent of the active.) Examples are:  a {\^E}”ad a mos-terir a ngalek ART man see-3pl.HUM ART child `The  man saw the children' a ngalek a le-bos-terir a {\^E}”ad ART child  PASS.3sg-see-3PL.HUM ART man `The children were seen by the man'  Even oblique terms may, apparently, be promoted: a ngelek-ek a sme{\^E}”er  er a tereter ART child-my sick.INTR with ART cold `My child is sick  with a cold' a tereter a l-se{\^E}”er er ngiy a ngelek-ek ART cold  PASS.3sg-sick with 3SG ART child-my `With a cold is being sick by  my child' (`A cold is being sick with by my child'.)However, these  are more like examples of topicalization than of passive: the Patient-Object  unaffected and there is, therefore, no evidence that it is promoted  to subject, and it is not abvious that the special prefix signaIs  demotion of the Agent, since with demotion agreement is usually lost,  not gained -- it may be that the function of the prefix is merely  to make the status of the Agent-Subject explicit, because it has  been moved from the usual Subject position. However, relativization  on the Patient requires this `passive': a le-bos-terir a {\^E}”ad  el ngalek ART PASS.3sg-see-3plHUM ART man REL child `The children  which were seen by the man' It is not possible to say: *a {\^E}”ad  a mos-terir el ngalek ART man see-3pl.HUM REL child `the children  which the man saw'This rather looks like an example of passivization  being used to promote the Patient-Object to Subject in a lg which  permits relativization on Subjects only (see 4.6). Yet, this merely  establishes a syntactic pivot and, as was argued in 4.3 pivots should  not necessarily be equated with Subjects. There is a rather different  problem in Dinka ( T. Andersen 1991), where there are two constructions,  both of which have features of passives, as exemplified by (subscripted  markers of creaky and breatby voice have been omitted): {\ldots}p.  1365.6 Functions of the passive (i) It promotes a non-Subject to  Subject position to make it available as a ' syntactic pivot. This  use has already been discussed in sorne detail (4.6). (ii) Closely  associated with this, especially with the use of pivots in coordination,  is the promotion of a non-Agent for topicalization. (iii) The passive  is often used, with the agent omitted, where the Agent is unknown,  non-specific or unimportant.(iv) ln some lgs the passive is used  because there are restrictions, in terms of animacy/agency etc.,  on the type of entity that may function as the Subject of an active  verbe Thus, according to Trithart (1979 -- see 4.6), passives are  favoured in Bantu lgs if they promote to Subject an NP higher on  a scale involving human/animate/inanimate. Conversely, as was noted  in 2.2, a strong preference for animate Subjects may block the passive  ln Korean, as in the example quoted by Song: John-{\'E}¨n k{\'E}¨  sakwa-l{\'E}¨l m{\v o}g-{\v o}ssta John-TOP the apple-ACC eat-PST`John  ate the apple' * k{\'E}¨ sakwa-n{\'E}¨n John-ege m{\v o}g-{\v o}sstathe  apple-TOP John-DAT eat-PASS-PST `The apple was eaten by John'Klaiman  (1988) argues that the issue in Korean is not one of animacy, but  of control. She offers (p. 61), using a different transcription from  that of Song, the examples: Id yAca-ka cA salamli tIN-ll kIlk-Assta  That Woman-NOM that man's back + OBJ scratch-PAST He woman scratched  the man's back' cA salam-Ii tIN-I kI yAca-eke kIlk-bi-Assta the man's  back-NoM that woman-by scratch-PASS-PAST `That man's back was scratched  by the woman' While the first sentence may mean that the woman scratched  the man's back with or without him being willing, the second can  only mean that the man let her scratch his back. In that sense he  is in control of the action. However, notions of agency, control  and animacy are conceptually closely linked, and it may be that all  or any of them are often involve:p. 1385.7 Varieties of passive p.142Passive:  related and problematic issues 6.1 Reflexives and indefinites as  passives Many lgs have retlexive constructions, i.e. constructions  in which the Object is indicated as being referentially identical  with the Subject by means of a reflex ive pronoun. Examples are the  {English} wash oneself, and the equivalent French se laver and Russian  myt' s'a. ln a number of lgs the same construction is also used as  a passive. In Russian, for instance, the passive is formed by using  the copula (the verb `to be') with verbs in the perfective aspect,  but by the reflexive fonn for verbs in the imperfective (SitWerska  1985: 247): p. 1456.2 Other passive-like constructions Many lgs use  an indetinite `they' or `he' l'one' as a Subject to convey a meaning  similar to that of an Agent-less passive. Thus in {English} `they  say . . .' has roughly the same meaning as `It is said . . . `. Similarly,  for Lakhota (N. America), Foley and Van Valin (198S: 334) quote:  {\ldots}However, in some languages there are constructions that are  very like these, but are treated as passive in that an obliquely-marked  Agent may be added; examples from Kimbundu (Bantu, Givon 1979: 211)  and Trukic (Micronesian, Jacobs 1976: 121) both quoted in Shimtani  1985: 845) are: Nzua a-mu-mono kwa marne .a :;me John they-him-saw  by me `John was seen by me' Waan re-liila --`` ree- I John they-hirn-killed  by-me `John was killed by me' },

@article{Winaweretal2007Russian,
	abstract = {English and Russian color terms divide the color spectrum differently.  Unlike {English}, Russian makes an obligatory distinction between  lighter blues ("goluboy") and darker blues ("siniy"). We investigated  whether this linguistic difference leads to differences in color  discrimination. We tested {English} and Russian speakers in a speeded  color discrimination task using blue stimuli that spanned the siniy/goluboy  border. We found that Russian speakers were faster to discriminate  two colors when they fell into different linguistic categories in  Russian (one siniy and the other goluboy) than when they were from  the same linguistic category (both siniy or both goluboy). Moreover,  this category advantage was eliminated by a verbal, but not a spatial,  dual task. These effects were stronger for difficult discriminations  (i.e., when the colors were perceptually close) than for easy discriminations  (i.e., when the colors were further apart). {English} speakers tested  on the identical stimuli did not show a category advantage in any  of the conditions. These results demonstrate that (i) categories  in language affect performance on simple perceptual color tasks and  (ii) the effect of language is online (and can be disrupted by verbal  interference).},

	abstract = {It is widely held that named color categories in the world's languages  are organized around universal focal colors and that these focal  colors tend to be chosen as the best examples of color terms across  languages. However, this notion has been supported primarily by data  from languages of industrialized societies. In contrast, recent research  on a language from a nonindustrialized society has called this idea  into question. We examine color-naming data from languages of 110  nonindustrialized societies and show that (i) best-example choices  for color terms in these languages cluster near the prototypes for  {English} white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue, and (ii) best-example  choices cluster more tightly across languages than do the centers  of category extensions, suggesting that universal best examples (foci)  may be the source of universal tendencies in color naming.},

@article{Rapacha2007Age-old,
	abstract = {Age-old socio-anthropology By LAL RAPACHA When one deeply ponders  the dynamics of redefining socio-anthropological identification of  the {Nepal}ese ethno-indigenous communities, s/he needs to be very  critical and precautious about the trends of classification and literature  available on them. Age-old or impressionistic rather than scientific  notions of ethnological descriptions of those communities are customary  amongst the native/foreign researchers and experts till today. One  of such commonest instances is Professor Dor Bahadur Bista's ethnological  descriptive efforts about the {Nepal}ese communities in the 'People  of {Nepal}', though magnum opus is often taken for granted by researchers  and experts in the history of socio-anthropology of {Nepal}. Many  critics and reviewers have had praised his academic achievement at  such a time of its publication when no one could think of such present  pluri-ethnic groups in the country. Although Prof Bista is credited  as the founder-father of socio-anthropology in {Nepal}, his knowledge  on the people of {Nepal} now has seriously been questioned in an  International Conference organized by Sociological/Anthropological  Society of {Nepal} (SASON) held on 11-13 December 2006 in Administrative  Staff College , Lalitpur. The Conference's main theme was 'Social  Sciences in a Multicultural World: Addressing the Persistence of  Deprivation, Conflict and Violence' with several other sub-themes  like 'Ethnicity', 'Perspectives on Conflict and Social Movements',  'Development Practices Observed', 'Political Transition, Democracy  and Development', 'Gender', 'Cross Cutting Issues', Human Rights  and Mental Health, 'Language and Culture', 'Resource Management',  'Perspectives on Agriculture and Development' and so forth. It was  in the 'ethnicity' sub-theme where Prof Bista, T. Ukyab and S. Akhikari  and Kir?tologist Iman S Chemjong were inquired and criticized bitterly  for claiming the {Kiranti}-K?its (hydro-exonym: Sunuwar) as "offshoots  of the Magars" and their Mother Tongue slightly differing from "the  Magar dialect". Actually their claims were the replica of Queen's  Gurkha Officers such as E. Vansittart, W. B. Northey and C.J. Morris's  writings on the {Kiranti}-K?its/Sunuwar during the British colonial  imperialism. Socio-anthropology scarcely smells in their observations.  Another most serious criticism in the conference was on Toni Hagen's  definition of the ethno-indigenous Sunuwar people of Wallo Kirat,  eastern {Nepal} "as excellent smiths and goldsmiths". Dr Hagen, who  introduced {Nepal} with his work 'Nepal: A Kingdom in the {Himalayas}'  has described them with such unscientific and inaccurate description  on page 123 of the {English} version published in 1980 by IBH Publishing  Co. The same faulty Hagen-notion has been imitated and reiterated  by the native scholars like JP Ananda, RR Subedi et al, K Parajuli  et al, MR Acharya, S Prapannacharya, Dr DP Aryal and Nanda R Shrestha/Keshav  Bhattarai blindly in their voluminous works with out any rectifications  or justifications. This scholarly copycat-trend has shown that socio-anthropology  as the science of society the mankind seems to be worn out and needs  to be revised in the true spirit of empirical science in present-day  {Nepal}'s context. Socio-anthropology in {Nepal} facing much more  criticisms these days is the classification and recognition of till  unknown ethnic groups by National Foundation for Development of Nationalities  (NFDIN) since sociologists/anthropologists are involved in the process  exclusive of linguists. The recognition of {Kiranti}-Surel as a separate  ethno-indigenous group having no separate language other than the  dialect of {Kiranti}-K?its of its own has posed problems in the defining  criteria of the term 'nationalities' whereas the {Kiranti}-Bakulochana  (Banatawa, Bayung, {Kulung}, {Lohorung}, Chamling, Nachhiring and  Yamphu) Movement has been voicing for a separate identity-recognition  based on the criteria of their unique languages and cultural practices.  Simply one Chepang ethnic group's division into three groups such  as Praja, Chepang and Bankariya seems nothing more than ethno-politicization  since the term Praja as an ethnic group was coined by King Mahendra's  Model of Democracy. Bankariya is a recent phenomenon as is Surel.  Furthermore, Dewans are also claiming as separate ethnic group either  from Kirat- {Yakkha} or Kirat-Yakthung in eastern {Nepal}. The same  problem of classification and recognition of some major tribes in  the western hills of the country has remained as nationalities' riddles  and even experts of sociology and anthropology are not exactly getting  through it. The practice of socio-anthropology in {Nepal} at Tribhuvan  University (TU) for more than four decades now is nothing more than  cramming the definitions and explanations of 'society' and 'humans  with certain sets of behaviors/features' provided by the Western  scholars and Xeroxed in {Nepal}. There exists no laboratory for genome/DNA  sampling observations and comparative analysis of anthropology as  science. Anthropological linguistics as one of the most essential  modules in socio-anthropological studies has not yet been introduced  in the Masters course as inseparable component of Sociology/Anthropology  in the University. As a result, most TU-products majoring Socio-anthropology  are not easily motivated towards the innovative research in anthropology  although it is very useful and relevant discipline for {Nepal}. Its  main impacts are visible as darkness in the case of ethno-politicization  among ethno-indigenous peoples of {Nepal} mocking science as puppet  in the hand of crooked politicians if not politics. Doing innovative  research is indispensable in order to understand and solve the riddles  of nationalities' identification and recognition for their inclusive  participation in political spheres demanded by the Federation of  Nationalities. It should firstly be started with restructured and  renovated paleontological ideas rather than from age-old socio-anthropological  practice of {Nepal}. This makes SASON's international conference  meaningful or socio-anthropology worth-practicing epistemologically  as empirical science for the sake of human society free from deprivation,  conflict and violence.

	abstract = {Native speakers of two languages (English and Ndonga) were compared  on three colour cognition tasks (sorting, triads and visual search)  in a test of the linguistic relativity hypothesis (Whorf, 1956).  The colour lexicons of these two languages differ because Ndonga  has no basic terms for ORANGE, PINK and PURPLE, and stimuli were  chosen to exploit this difference. On the sorting task (sorting into  similarity-groups) for each language, nominally similar colours were  grouped together more often than nominally dissimilar colours. On  the triads task (choosing the most different of three colours), when  the most nominally isolated colour differed for the two language-groups,  each group tended to choose their nominal isolate. On the search  task (scanning for target colours among distractors), targets were  either in a different {English} category than distractors (cross-category),  or some distractors were in the same {English} category as distractors  (within-category). The 'cost' in speed of having within-category  distractors was much greater for the {English} than for the Ndonga.  Overall, these data suggest that a core universal component is modulated  by a small relativist influence. The differences in the visual search  task are consistent with language affecting pre-attentive processes  (an indirect language effect) as well as exerting on-line influences  (a direct effect).},

To clarify the  relation between language and arithmetic, we studied numerical cognition  in speakers of Munduruku, an Amazonian language with a very small  lexicon of number words. Although the Munduruku lack words for numbers  beyond 5, they are able to compare and add large approximate numbers  that are far beyond their naming range. However, they fail in exact  arithmetic with numbers larger than 4 or 5. Our results imply a distinction  between a nonverbal system of number approximation and a language-based  counting system for exact number and arithmetic.},

Here an alter- native paradigm of language change is  set forth to explain the process. This paradigm is, among other things,  dependent on the fact that more than one structural description may  be assigned to a given sentence. If the hearer assigns a different  structural description to a sentence than the speaker does, and if  a rule based on this 'deviant' structural description spreads, then  the language exhibits change. Under certain circumstances, then,  agentless OV constructions may be mis-assigned the constituent structure  of a passive SV construction-where the object of the active, transitive  sentence is interpreted as the subject of its passive, intransitive  counterpart. },

This suffix is inserted  as a last resort where UG makes the assignment of case to the object  (transitive aspectless embedded clauses) and the extraction of the  subject with ergative agreement (aspectual main clauses) otherwise  impossible. Therefore, this notion cannot be restricted to instances  of movement, as in Chomsky (1994). Rather, it must also include lexical  insertion of affixal material in the deriva- tion, as in the broader  view found in Chomsky (1991). },

@article{Narasimhanetal2005Argument,
	abstract = {An influential claim in the child language literature posits that  children use structural cues in the input language to acquire verb  meaning (Gleitman, 1990). One such cue is the of arguments co-occurring  with the verb, which provides an indication as to the event type  associated with the verb (Fisher, 1995). In some languages however  (e.g. {Hindi}), verb arguments are ellipted relatively freely, subject  to certain discourse-pragmatic constraints. In this paper, we address  three questions: Is the pervasive argument ellipsis characteristic  of adult {Hindi} also found in {Hindi}-speaking caregivers' ? If  so, do children consequently make errors in verb transitivity? How  early do children learning a split-ergative language, such as {Hindi}, exhibit sensitivity to discourse-pragmatic influences on argument  realization? We show that there is massive argument ellipsis in caregivers'  input to 3-4 year-olds. However, children acquiring {Hindi} do not  make transitivity errors in their own speech. Nor do they elide arguments  randomly. Rather, even at this early age, children appear to be sensitive  to discourse-pragmatics in their own spontaneous speech production.  These findings in a split-ergative language parallel patterns of  argument realization found in children acquiring both nominative-accusative  languages (e.g. Korean) and ergative-absolutive languages (e.g. {Tzeltal},  Inuktitut).},

@article{Lindseyetal2002Color,
	abstract = {Many languages have no basic color term for "blue." Instead, they  call short-wavelength stimuli "green" or "dark". We show that this  cultural, linguistic phenomenon could result from accelerated aging  of the eye because of high, chronic exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B)  in sunlight (e.g., phototoxic lens brunescence). Reviewing 203 world  languages, we found a significant relationship between UV dosage  and color naming: In low-UV localities, languages generally have  the word "blue"; in high-UV areas, languages without "blue" prevail.  Furthermore, speakers of these non-"blue" languages often show blue-yellow  color vision deficiency. We tested our phototoxicity hypothesis in  a color-naming experiment, using computerized, colorimetric simulations  of Munsell colors as viewed through clear and brunescent lenses.  As predicted, our young subjects used "blue" as in {English} when  the simulated lens was clear, but named colors as in tropical languages  when the lens was dense. Our within-subjects design precludes a cultural  explanation for this result.},

The 'relativist' position holds that  the correct answer to both questions is Yes, based on data from the  Berinmo language of Papua New Guinea. It is shown here that the Berinmo  facts instead support a more complex view -- that cross-language  color naming follows non-trivial universal tendencies, while cross-language  color-naming differences do indeed correlate with differences in  color cognition. The rhetoric of 'relativity' versus 'universalism'  impedes understanding of cross-language color naming and cognition.},

@article{Haspelmath1990Grammaricalization,
	annote = {Haspelmath, Martin. 1990. "The grammaticization of passive morphology".  Studies in Language 14.1:25-71.p. 25To this almost excessive attention  from the point of view of syntax corresponds a relative negligence  of the morphological aspects of passive constructions, most importantly  the passive marker on the verb (other morphological devices used  in passive constructions, such as instrumental or locative markers  of agent phrases, are normally not specific to passive constructions  and are not considered ?passive morphology? here).Indeed, the passive  can be regarded as first and foremost a verbal morphological category  whose meaning implies certain changes in the clause structure.p.  26-27Bur first we must ask whether passives are possible without  any particular morphological marking. If the passive were basically  a syntactic phenomenon, a relation-changing rule analogous to object  raising or possessor raising, or a pragmatically-motivated rule like  topic fronting or interrogative phrase fronting (?wh-movement?),  it would not be unexpected to find passive constructions without  special morphology on the verb.Dryer 1982, defending the view that  the universal and essential part of the passive is its syntactic  property, observes that passive morphology can be of different types  (not only auxiliary + participle, but also suffix on the verb, etc.)  or even be completely lacking. He concludes that passive morphology  is just an accidental fact about individual languages.{\^a}{\euro}ž``Given  the following definition of passive constructions:A construction  is called passive if:(i) the active subject corresponds either to  a non-obligatory oblique phrase or to nothing; and(ii) the active  direct object (if any) corresponds to the subject of the passive;  and(iii) the construction is somehow restricted vis-{\`a}-vis another  unrestricted construction (the active), e.g. less frequent, functionally  specialized, not fully productive.I claim that in general passive  constructions without passive morphology do not exist.``...The Kinyarwanda  construction mentioned by Keenan 1985: 255 does not qualify as a  passive because the postverbal agent cannot be omitted and the preposed  patient exhibits almost no subject properties. Kimenyi1980:141ff  (Keenan?s source) is careful not to call this construction ?passive,?  but ?object-subject reversal.?p. 32In many lgs, the gr. Morphemes  that mark the passive are not restricted to this function but can  have other uses, such as reflexive, reciprocal, ancticausative and  potential passive. ? The question now is whether any pattern can  be discerned in the distribution of this uses.p. 595.4 The basic  functions of the passiveIt has been long recognized that the two  main functions of the passive are the foregrounding (or topicalization)  of the patient and the backgrounding of the agent (e.g. Gabelentz  1861:{\S}2, with references to earlier work). And just as old is  probably the question of which of these two functions is the dominating  one. Among recent functionalist studies, Givon 1979 emphasizes the  topicalization function, whereas Shibatani 1985 takes ?agent defocusing?  as the main function of the passive. In the relational syntactic  debates of the 70s, Perlmutter and Postal 1977analyzed passives as  advancement of the initial direct object to subject, whereas Comrie  1977 favored an analysis where the initial subject is demoted spontaneously.  And going back to the earlier part of this century, Brugmann took  topicalization as the main function of the passive, whereas Meillet  considered the agent backgrounding function more important.},

	abstract = {The central topic of this study is to investigate three and fourplace  predicate in Yaqui, which are characterized by having multiple object  arguments. As with other Southern UtoAztecan languages, it has been  said that Yaqui follows the Primary/Secondary Object pattern (Dryer  1986). Actually, Yaqui presents three patterns: verbs like nenka  `sell' follow the direct-indirect object pattern, verbs like miika  `give' follow the primary object pattern, and verbs like chijakta  `sprinkle' follow the locative alternation pattern; the primary object  pattern is the exclusive one found with derived verbs. This paper  shows that the contrast between direct object and primary object  languages is not absolute but rather one of degree, and hence two  object selection principles are needed to explain this mixed system.  The two principles are not limited to Yaqui but are found in other  languages as well, including {English}. },

This addresses the classic Whorfian question about whether language  can determine thought. Results of numerical tasks with varying cognitive  demands show that numerical cognition is clearly affected by the  lack of a counting system in the language. Performance with quantities  greater than three was remarkably poor, but showed a constant coefficient  of variation, which is suggestive of an analog estimation process.},

Here we  show that this phenomenon is not limited to color: The perception  of animal figures (cats and dogs) was more strongly affected by linguistic  categories for stimuli presented to the right visual field than those  presented to the left. Moreover, the magnitude of the visual field  asymmetry was reduced when demands on verbal working memory were  increased by a secondary task. This reduction did not occur when  the secondary task imposed demands on spatial working memory. Taken  together, these results demonstrate that the lateralized Whorf effect  may be quite general, reflecting an interaction of linguistic and  perceptual codes primarily in the left hemisphere.},

Reaction times  to targets in the right visual field were faster when the target  and distractor colors had different names; in contrast, reaction  times to targets in the left visual field were not affected by the  names of the target and distractor colors. Moreover, this pattern  was disrupted when participants performed a secondary task that engaged  verbal working memory but not a task making comparable demands on  spatial working memory. It appears that people view the right (but  not the left) half of their visual world through the lens of their  native language, providing an unexpected resolution to the language-and-thought  debate.},

These  languages behave differently regarding passivization: Yaqui systematically  shows a morphological passive with the verbal suffix --wa, whereas  Warih{\'\i}o shows a heterogeneous group of passives (tentatively):  morphological, periphrastic and notional-functional.},
	annote = {Summarized:Some researchers (Keenan 1985, Haspelmath 1990, Dixon  and Aikhenvald 2000)establish a structural feature as the main definitional  criterion for a passive, whereas others (Shibatani 1985, Comrie 1988)  talk about the vantages and consequences of a approach in terms of  prototypes. Even more, Comrie (2003) questions himself about the  inappropriateness of the question: ``What is a passive? Shibatani  (1985:833) gives primary importance to the defocusing of the agent:  ``the defocusing of an agent in the passive is not merely a consequence  of an object promotion or of topicalization, but rather is the basic  and primary function of the passive construction.''Shibatani lists  three facts that support this claim: * passives generally do not  express agents overtly, * some lgs avoid the presence of an agent  in a passive (e.g. Finnish, Cheremis, Turkish), and * passivization  generally does not apply to non-agentive intr. He claims that a clause  without an agent or agent-like participant is impossible to passivize  since there is no agent to defocus.The necessity of a functional  definition of the passive turns evident on investigating lgs such  as Warih{\'\i}o given that in this lg we one can find clauses that  fulfill the passive definition given by Giv{\'o}n (2004), who defines  the passive clause functionally as ``the clause-type whereby the  agent of the corresponding active is radically de-topicalized and  its patient becomes, by default, the only topical argument'', then  the following typology of the cross-linguistically most common major  clause-types that perform this function may be obtained. This definition  has the characteristic that a passive is obligatorily derived. A  more neutral definition is given by Andersen (1991: 111-112): {\^a}{\euro}žThe  passive is a transitive construction containing two participants,  i.e. an initiator (prototypically an agent) and another (i.e. a `patient')  exhibiting the feature [+affected], whereby only the `patient' is  specified in the `core' of the clause''.What I want to illustrate  by describing all these different accounts is the diversity of criteria  on stipulating a passive. Even those approaches that include non-prototypical  instances show differences on how they use terms such as `transitivity'  and `valency'.Following Shibatani (1985) in his approach to passive,  I emphasize that all its features have equal importance, and a construction  lacking even one of the features is a non-prototypical instance of  a passive.Notesi Shibatani uses the term `agent defocusing' in an  attempt to cover different but related phenomena such as the absence  of the mention of an agent, mention of an agent in a non-prominent  syntactic slot, the blurring of the identity of an agent by the use  of plural forms, and the indirect reference to an agent by the use  of an oblique case.},

	abstract = {The Pirah{\~a}language challenges simplistic application of Hockett's  nearly universally accepted design features of human language by  showing that some of these features (interchangeability, displacement,  and productivity) may be culturally constrained. In particular, Pirah{\~a}culture  constrains communication to nonabstract subjects which fall within  the immediate experience of interlocutors. This constraint explains  a number of very surprising features of Pirah{\~a}grammar and culture:  the absence of numbers of any kind or a concept of counting and of  any terms for quantification, the absence of color terms, the absence  of embedding, the simplest pronoun inventory known, the absence of  "relative tenses," the simplest kinship system yet documented, the  absence of creation myths and fiction, the absence of any individual  or collective memory of more than two generations past, the absence  of drawing or other art and one of the simplest material cultures  documented, and the fact that the Pirah{\~a}are monolingual after  more than 200 years of regular contact with Brazilians and the Tupi-Guarani-speaking  Kawahiv.

It has  been claimed that this is the case for thoughts about numbers: Children  cannot have the concept of exact numbers until they know the words  for them, and adults in cultures whose languages lack a counting  vocabulary similarly cannot possess these concepts. Here, using classical  methods of developmental psychology, we show that children who are  monolingual speakers of two Australian languages with very restricted  number vocabularies possess the same numerical concepts as a comparable  group of {English}-speaking indigenous Australian children.},

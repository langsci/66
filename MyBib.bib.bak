  Abstract                 = {Are thoughts impossible without the words to express them? It has been claimed that this is the case for thoughts about numbers: Children cannot have the concept of exact numbers until they know the words for them, and adults in cultures whose languages lack a counting vocabulary similarly cannot possess these concepts. Here, using classical methods of developmental psychology, we show that children who are monolingual speakers of two Australian languages with very restricted number vocabularies possess the same numerical concepts as a comparable group of English-speaking indigenous Australian children.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT A major unclarity in current grammatical terminology surrounds the delimitation of passive and ergative from one another, especially since many writers have been unclear about the criteria for considering a construction to be ergative or passive. Three criteria for identifying the two phenomena are suggested: (i) passive and ergative are alike in that both involve assignment of at least some subject properties to the patient rather than the agent, although the extent of this assignment is typically greater for the passive; (ii) passive and ergative differ in that the ergative typically involves greater integration of the agent phrase into the syntax of the clause;(iii) passive and ergative differ in terms of markedness -- the passive is a marked construction, whereas the ergative is typically an unmarked construction. In passing, the notions of active and antipassive are also discussed. While clarification is introduced into the controversy, it remains true that the definitions proposed are in terms of prototypes rather than in terms of necessary-and-sufficient conditions, so that inevitably there will be borderline cases that are not assignable unequivocally to one construction or the other.1. INTRODUCTION: THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM In the 1970s, many linguists were deeply intrigued by the syntactic properties of Dyirbal (Jirrbal) [{\ldots}]. Linguists were already familiar with evidence for the notion of subject in English from conjunction reduction, in particular from the fact that in English the subject of a second conjunct can be omitted if it is coreferential with the subject of a preceding conjunct, as in 1-2.p. 10[{\ldots}]ln Dyirbal, however, in the basic voice (a concept to be elaborated below), it is P's and S's that can serve as coreferential noun phrases for conjunction reduction, in contrast to A's, as in (4)-(5):[{\ldots}]ln my own work on Dyirbal, following in its essentials that of Dixon, 1 considered such examples to be clear evidence of ergativity in Dyirbal (see, for instance, Comrie 1978). At around this time, l had occasion to discuss this feature of Dyirbal, separately, with two linguists who advocated radically different analyses. [{\ldots}]p. 11Linguist 1 suggested to me that the Dyirbal construction is not ergative, because it fails to satisfy the definition of ergative: assignment of a special case ta the subject of a transitive construction. Since, in Dyirbal, it is the P rather than the A that is subject of a two-place predicate, and since bath P and S stand in the absolutive, there is no special case for the transitive subject. Thus this linguist presupposed a clearcut definition of `ergative', a definition which the Dyirbal phenomenon fails to satisfy.Linguist 2 suggested that the Dyirbal construction is in fact nothing other than a passive. If we consider the relations A, P, and S as being assigned in the (underived) lexical specification of a predicate structure, then in an English passive clause like (7) the assignment of A, P, and S is the same as in the truth-functionally equivalent active sentence: (7) The woman (P) was hit by the man (A). If we then carry out the conjunction reduction test, we find that in (7) it is the P, i.e. the woman, which can be trigger or target for conjunction reduction, as in (8), which has the interpretation of (9), not (10): (8) The woman was hit by the man and ran away. (9) The woman was hit by the man and the woman ran away. (10) The woman was hit by the man and the man ran away.[{\ldots}]Just as English has a passive, in which P assumes subject properties, so Dyirbal has an antipassive, in which A assumes subject properties, as in (11)-(12): p. 12[{\ldots}]Sentence (12) thus has the same interpretation as its English translation with an active second conjunct, and Linguist 2 of my anecdote said that the so-called antipassive in Dyirbal is in fact nothing but an active. At the time, the debate simply left three linguists advocating different positions -- (i) the Dyirbal basic voice construction is ergative; (ii) the DyirbaI basic voice construction is passive; (iii) the Dyirbal basic voice construction is something different from either of these -- without any basis on which one could convince the others of the errors of their ways. In the body of this paper, 1 will not attempt to set up necessary-and-sufficient conditions to delimit each of passive and ergative, for the simple reason that I do not believe that such conditions are viable -- while they can be established by fiat, there is no reason to suppose that any such definition will be linguistically significant, Rather, l will attempt to analyze the various criteria that are relevant in distinguishing passive, ergative, and other related phenomena from one another, in part in order to clarify the basis of the controversy outlined above; the resulting definitions will involve prototypes, parallel ta the definition of the passive suggested by Shibatani (1985) . [{\ldots}]2. THE SYNTAX OF THE AGENT PHRASE 2.1. Subject properties and the agent phrase At least part of many traditional definitions of the passive is that the P appears as subject of the passive (whereas the A would appear as subject of the corresponding active). I believe that this traditional insight is correct, and that part of the definition of the prototypical passive must therefore include the idea that the P is subject of this construction (although, of course, some passives will not be prototypical, for instance impersonal passives). We can make this a little more specific. In general, it is uncontroversial that the single argument of an intransitive predicate (S) is the subject of that predicate. Thus, by saying that some argument of a transitive predicate is subject of its clause, we are effectively claiming that it shares properties with S's of intransitive clauses, properties that are moreover not shared by the other argument of the transitive predicate -- i.e. these properties are subject properties (though it should be noted that nothing hinges on the term `subject properties' -- all that is required is similar behavior of S and A as opposed to P, or of S and P as opposed to A). In the prototypical passive, then, the P should share properties with S's that are not shared by A's of the passive construction.English can serve as an excellent illustration of this kind of passive. S's have a number of properties, for instance nominative case (for those pronouns that have a nominative-oblique case distinction), triggering verb agreement, being trigger or target for conjunction reduction, undergoing Equi, subject raising, etc., as shown in (13)-(16): (13) We were running. (14) The man danced and (the man) ran away. (15) We persuaded Mother to leave (= that Mother leave). (16) We believe Mother to have left (= that Mother has left).The P's of passive constructions share exactly these same properties, as in (17)-(20): (17) We were bit by him. (18) The man was hit by the woman and (the man) ran away. (19) We persuaded Mother to be examined by the doctor (= that Mother be examined by the doctor). . (20) We believe Mother to have been examined by the doctor (= that Mother has been examined by the doctor). The A's of passive constructions do not share these properties. Thus, in (17) him cannot stand in the nominative, nor can the verb agree with it. Sentence (18) cannot be interpreted to mean `{\ldots} and the woman ran away'. Alongside (19), there is no sentence we persuaded the doctor for Mother to be examined, meaning specifically `to be examined by the doctor' , and there is no sentence parallel to (20) of the form *we believe (by) the doctor for Mother, to have been examined (by). Quite generally, we can say that in English P's of passive constructions have the full range of morphological and syntactic subject properties, the same as S's of intransitive predicates.Turning now to the ergative, it must be the case that at least some properties are common to P and S. However, if we look at the constructions of different languages that have been considered ergative, we find considerable differences in the extent to which such properties are shared. In some languages, the shared properties do not extend beyond case marking of noun phrases. For instance, in Warlpiri (Walbiri), an Aboriginal language of Central Australia, noun phrases have ergative case marking: both S and P stand in the absolutive, while A stands in the ergative; however, no other morphological or syntactic properties seem to group S and P together as opposed to A. Even verb agreement operates on a nominative-accusative basis, as can be seen in (21)-(23) (Hale, 1973): (21) Ngatju ka-rna purla-mi. I:ABS AUX-1SG:NOM shout-NONPAST `I shout.' (Hale 1973: ?) (22) Ngatjulu-rlu ka-rna-ngku nyuntu nya-nyi. I-ERG AUX-1SG:NOM-2SG:ACC you:ABS see-NONPAST `I see you.' (Hale 1973: ?)(23) Nyuntulu-rlu ka-npa-tju ngatju nya-nyi. you-ERG AUX-2SG:NOM-1SG:ACC I:ABS see-NONPAST `You see me.' (Hale 1973: ?)For noun phrases, we have absolutive ngatju `l', nyuntu `you', ergative ngatjulurlu `I', nyuntulurlu `you'; but the verb agreement affixes, attached to the auxiliary element, show nominative --rna `first person', -npa `second person', accusative --tju `first person', -ngku `second person'.One syntactic process that is sensitive to subjecthood in Warlpiri is switch-reference, whereby dependent verbs take different suffixes according to whether they have the same subject as or a different subject from the verb on which they are dependent; `subject' here means S or A, not P. This is illustrated by Warlpiri examples (24)-(27) (Hale, 1976: 82): (24) Ngarka-ngku ka karli tjarnti-rni, man-ERG AUX boomerang:ABS trim-NONPASTnyina-niyitja-kara-rlu. sit-INF-SS-ERG `The man is trimming the boomerang while sitting.' (Hale, 1976: 82)(25) Ngarka ka wangka-mi, karli tjarnti-rninytja-kara.man:ABS AUX speak-NONPAST boomerang-ABS trim-lNF-SS`The man is speaking while trimming the boomerang.' (Hale, 1976: 82)(In (24), note that the infinitive agrees in case with the transitive subject of the main clause.) For a fuller account of switch reference in Australian languages, reference may be made to Austin (1981). Opposite extreme, we find languages like Dyirbal, in whose ergative construction virtually all morphological and syntactic subject properties adhere to the P and not to the A. This was illustrated, for conjunction reduction, in sentences (4)-( 6) above.Ta summarize this section: One feature shared by passive and ergative is the assignment of at least some subject properties to the P of the clause. In the passive, it is usual for all or most subject properties to be assigned to the P in this way. In the ergative construction, it is more typical for a more limited number of subject properties to be assigned in this way -- perhaps only case marking -- although it is also possible for a wider range of subject properties to be assigned to the P, or even all of them. In this respect, the Dyirbal ergative is more like a passive than is that of most other languages with ergative constructions, and accordingly least like an active construction. If one is contrasting the Dyirbal ergative construction with an active construction in a language like English, the Dyirbal is indeed an extreme example of ergativity; in comparison with a passive construction, however, it is certainly the most passive-like of ergative constructions. Thus, whether one regards Dyirbal as an `extreme' ergative language (which is crucially not the same as a typical ergative language) depends in part on one's point of reference.It follows from the above that the characterization of an active (nonergative) construction in terms of subject properties is one where all the subject properties in a clause with a two-place predicate adhere to the A. This particular criterion is, of course, also satisfied by the Dyirbal antipassive. So just as, on this criterion, ergative and passive are similar (P bas subject properties), so too active and antipassive are similar (A has subject properties).p. 16 2.2. Integration of the agent phrase into clause syntaxThe subject properties discussed in Section 2.1 can be viewed as a special case of a more general phenomenon: the extent to which a given noun phrase is integrated into the syntax of its clause. By `integration into the syntax' , l mean the extent to which the syntax of the language makes reference to the phrase in question. If we consider the P and the A of the English passive, for instance, it is clear that a number of rules refer to the P - in general, all of those rules that refer to subjects -- whereas few if any syntactic rules refer to the A (agent phrase). In ergative constructions, however, it is quite common for syntactic rules to refer to the A. Thus one difference between passive and ergative is the greater integration of the A into clause syntax in the ergative than in the passive construction. One way in which this greater integratedness is often manifested is by verb agreement. It is rare for a clear-cut passive construction to involve verb agreement with the agent phrase. With the ergative construction, however, it is extremely common for the verb to agree with the A. We have already illustrated this for Warlpiri, where the A, though standing in the ergative, triggers agreement (in fact, nominative agreement). The agreement triggered may, however, also be on an ergative-absolutive basis, as in the following Quich{\'e} examples (Lyle Campbell, personal communication):[{\ldots}]p. 17Of course, some ergative constructions do not involve verb agreement with the A. In Dyirbal this holds, but irrelevantly so, because there is no verb agreement at all. In Hindi, however, although the verb in the ergative construction does often agree with its P, it never agrees with the A: [{\ldots}]A phenomenon somewhat similar to verb agreement with a P is found in Bahasa Indonesia, in one of the passive constructions. In this construction, the active prefix meN- of the verb is replaced by a pronoun:(31) Saya akan men-jemput dia jam enam. 1 FUT ACT-pick:up her hour six `I will pick her up at six o'clock.' (Comrie 1988: 17)(32) Dia akan saya jemput jam enam. Her FUT l pick:up hour six `She will be picked up by me at six o'clock.' (Comrie 1988: 17)The fact that the A pronoun here occupies the structural slot of the voice prefix (cf. active men-jempu, passive di-jemput) suggests a high degree of integration into the structure of the clause. It has long been noted that the so-called passive in many Indonesian and Philippine languages is rather different nom the passive of most other languages, and is in many respects more similar to an ergative construction. The integration of the A into clause structure is one of the reasons for this. (For other reasons, see below and Section 3.)In the Dyirbal ergative construction, the A might at first sight seem minimally if at all integrated into clause structure, in particular in that it neither triggers nor is target of conjunction reduction. However, this view is exaggerated. It is possible for the A of a Dyirbal clause in the basic voice to trigger conjunction reduction, but this non-standard configuration of participants must be marked by adding the suffix --ngurra (which excludes tense suffixes) to the verb of the second clause, as in (33): (33) Bala yugu banggul yara-nggu CLASS:IV:ABS stick:ABS CLASS:MASC:ERG man-ERGmada-n, waynyji-ngurra. throw-NONFUT ascend-NGURRA `The man threw the stick and (the man) went uphill.' (Comrie 1988: 17)p. 18(The noun yugu `stick' belongs to class IV.) In this respect, the Dyirbal basic voice differs from the English passive, since in English there is no `trick' to enable the A of the passive construction to serve as trigger for conjunction reduction, Thus, although in terms of the criteria discussed in Section 2 the Dyirbal construction is in many ways more passive-like than ergative-like, sentences like (33) do demonstrate some greater degree of integration of the A into clause syntax.Another way in which the syntactic integration of the agent phrase into the structure of the sentence manifests itself is the extent to which the agent phrase is obligatory (i. e. required by the syntax of the language) or optional. In English, in the active voice, the expression of the agent phrase (as subject) is obligatory, so that alongside Fred struck Bill there is no *struck Bill meaning that some unspecified agent struck Bill. In the English passive, on the contrary, omission of the agent is perfectly acceptable, and is indeed more frequent in actual practice than inclusion of the agent phrase, as in Bill was struck (by Fred). In investigating agent omissibility, of course, one can only consider languages in which noun phrases are not in genera freely omissible -- thus, in Japanese agents can be freely omitted in active and passive sentences, but this is just a special case of the general free omissibility of noun phrases -- and one must likewise exclude instances where noun phrases are omissible provided they leave a trace in the form of verb agreement: thus the fact that Spanish {\'e}l canta `he sings' can be reduced to canta (with a third person singular verb) is not to be regarded as an instance of agent deletion, since the agent is still present in the third person singular inflection of the verb.In the prototypical cases, the agent is not omissible in the ergative construction (subject to the restrictions above), but is omissible, and is in fact normally omitted, from the passive construction. Examination of constructions that have given difficulties in the past as to their classification as passive or ergative once again reveals constructions that correspond neither to the prototypical passive nor to the prototypical ergative, but combine features of both. In Philippine languages, for instance, it is not normal to omit the agent phrase in the so-called passive voice, providing another motivation for considering this construction more ergative-like than the prototypical passive. By contrast, in Dyirbal agent phrases are freely omissible, giving rise to sentences that are interpreted as having an unspecified agent, just like English agentless passives. Thus, starting from the first clause of example (33), it is possible to omit the agent phrase to give the sentence, wellformed in isolation, bala yugu mada-n `the stick was thrown, someone threw the stick'. However, there is still a slight difference between this phenomenon in Dyirbal and the prototypical passive: in the prototypical passive, it is normal for the agent to be omitted, whereas this is not the case in Dyirbal.p. 193. MARKEDNESS In addition to the criteria noted in Section 2, there is one other important criterion -- or rather set of criteria -- that many linguists have used intuitively in distinguishing between passive and ergative constructions. The passive is viewed typically (prototypically) as a marked voice, contrasting with an unmarked active. The ergative, by contrast, is typically a manifestation of the unmarked voice; indeed many languages with an ergative construction have no voice contrast (e.g. Warlpiri), while in Dyirbal the contrast is between an unmarked ergative and a marked antipassive. Thus passive and ergative are distinguished as marked and unmarked, respectively; likewise, active and antipassive are distinguished as unmarked and marked, respectively. In order to flesh out this argument, however, it is necessary to elaborate somewhat on what is meant by markedness, or rather on what criteria are (potentially) relevant. In what follows, l will suggest a number of in large measure logically independent criteria, which in clear cases an point in the same direction (although in some cases they point in different directions -- these are typically those cases that have been considered unclear in earlier work). One criterion that can be invoked is `raw frequency'. In English, there is a clear preponderance of active over passive, even if one restricts the count of active sentences to those whose passive counterparts would be grammatical (in particular, in order to exclude intransitive clauses, which in English lack passive counterparts). In Dyirbal, by contrast, the ergative construction (or, more generally, the basic voice, without the antipassive suffix) is clearly preponderant over the antipassive, again even if one restricts the count of basic voice clauses to those with a grammatical antipassive counterpart. A second criterion is `formal complexity' , i.e. the idea that the member of an opposition that is marked within the system will also be marked formally, will contain more morphemes than its unmarked counterpart. Again, both English and Dyirbal fit in well with this characterization. The English passive has two or three more morphemes than the active (the auxiliary be, the past participle suffix on the main verb, plus the preposition by on the A if this is expressed). The Dyirbal antipassive has one extra morpheme on the verb, namely the antipassive suffix --ngay. Criterion number three is `degree of productivity': in general, all or most verbs have the unmarked form, whereas many verbs may lack the marked form. Again, English and Dyirbal illustrate this well. Although there are isolated verbs and uses of verbs that have a passive but no active (e.g. for most speakers there is no active equivalent of be said to, as in he is said to be an idiot), there are many verbs that have an active but no passive -- in particular all intransitive verbs. In DyirbaI, likewise, while probably ail or nearly all verbs have a basic voice, only two-place verbs have an antipassive. The fourth criterion, and the last to be considered here, is discourse distribution. Certain constructions can only occur in specified positions within a discourse -- these are marked -- whereas other constructions the unmarked ones -- are less restricted. The Dyirbal antipassive is clearly marked by this criterion: it hardly ever occurs as the initial clause of a sentence, but only in non-initial clauses, when required by the coreference constraint on omission of noun phrases; by contrast, the basic voice can occur on both initial and noninitial clauses of sentences. In English, the difference between active an, passive on this criterion is not so clear, although in general one can say that in English the active is preferred unless there are good discourse reasons (such as topicality or topicworthiness of the P) for using the passive. In a language lire Warlpiri, with no voice opposition, the ergative is, of course, the unmarked voice, by default. Although English and Dyirbal clearly occupy opposite poles in terms of markedness -- in English the construction with A as subject is unmarked, in Dyirbal it is the construction with P that is unmarked do share in common the clear result of application of these criteria. In some languages, however, the markedness criteria give less than clear results, especially in the case of Indonesian and even more so Philippine languages. In these languages, the passive is used much more frequently than in English, and indeed in some texts in some Philippine languages the passive (often called patient/goal-focus) is actually more frequent than the active (or actor-focus) for two-place predicates. There is often no difference in degree of formal markedness between active and passive (e.g. Bahasa Indonesia active men-jemput, passive di-jemput `pick up', discussed above), or even lesser formal markedness of the passive (e.g. passive saya jemput `picked up by me' versus active saya men-jemput `I picked up'). Passives are highly productive, especially in Philippine languages, where not only P's but also recipients, benefactives, instruments, locatives, etc. can often be freely made subject. Moreover, in Tagalog the fairly strong constraint whereby the passive (patient/goal-focus) must be used when the P is a definite noun phrase means, in the absence of any similar constraint on the use of the active (actor --focus) when the A is definite, that there is actually one discourse environment from which the active is barred to the benefit of the passive. In many Indonesian and Philippine languages, then, the markedness criterion gives equivocal results, and this, l would claim, accounts for the hesitation scholars of these languages have had in using terms like `active' and `passive' and their tendency to create idiosyncratic terminology (Iike `focus') to avoid using the traditional terminology in non-prototypical ways. 4. CONCLUSIONS In this article, I have tried to establish criteria by which one can distinguish between passive and ergative, and more generally characterize each of these two construction types. The resulting characterizations are prototypes, rather than necessary-and-sufficient conditions. While one could, of course, establish arbitrary necessary-and-sufficient conditions that would lead to discrete cut-off points between passive and ergative, I would argue that such definitions are indeed arbitrary, corresponding neither to linguists' intuitions about what passive and ergative are nor to any significant properties of language.In terms of these criteria, the prototypical passive turns out to be a construction where the P is clearly subject, where the A is at most minimally integrated into the syntax of its clause, and moreover a construction which is marked in terms of voice. The prototypical ergative is a construction where the P has at least some subject properties (though the more typical ergative P bas few such properties), where the A is well integrated into the syntax of its clause, and moreover a construction which is unmarked in terms of voice. In clear cases, this corresponds well to earlier assignments of the terms: English has a prototypical passive, Warlpiri has a prototypical ergative. For the unclear cases, these definitions in terms of prototypes clarify precisely why these cases should have been unclear -- and why in a phenomena on the borderline between two categories. The Dyirbal ergative (basic voice) is clearly unmarked, but its P has the full range of subject properties and it's a is minimally integrated into the syntax of its clause. In Indonesian and Philippine languages, the markedness criteria are indecisive and the A of the putative passive is rather well integrated into clause syntax.If we think back to the anecdote with which I opened this discussion in section 1, then it is clear that the main problem was that the participants either did not have clear-cut criteria, or were using arbitrary criteria that were not accepted by the other participants. Their dispute has not been resolved. Rather, I have tried to show why it cannot be resolved. },
  Annote                   = {''A major unclarity in current grammatical terminology surrounds the de- limitation of passive and ergative from one another.3 criteria for identifying passive and ergative are suggested: (i) passive and ERG are alike in that both involve assignment of at least some subject properties to the P rather than A, although the extent of this assignment is typically greater for the passive; (ii) passive and ERG differ in that the ERG typically involves greater integration of the A phrase into the syntax of the clause;(iii) passive and ERG differ in terms of markedness -- the passive is a marked construction, whereas the ergative is typically an unmarked construction. INTRODUCTION: In this paper, I will not attempt to set up necessary-and-sufficient conditions to delimit each of passive and ergative, for the simple reason that I do not believe that such conditions are viable -- while they can be established by fiat, there is no reason to suppose that any such definition will be linguistically significant, Rather, l will attempt to analyze the various criteria that are relevant in distinguishing passive, ergative, and other related phenomena from one another, in part in order to clarify the basis of the controversy outlined above; the resulting definitions will involve prototypes, parallel ta the definition of the passive suggested by Shibatani (1985) . 2.1. Subject properties and the agent phrase Part of many traditional definitions of the passive is that the P appears as subject of the passive (whereas the A would appear as subject of the corresponding active). I believe that this tradit. insight is correct, and that part of the definition of the prototypical passive must therefore include the idea that the P is subject of this construction (although, of course, some passives will not be prototypical, for instance impersonal passives). We can make this a little more specific. In general, it is uncontroversial that the single argument of an intr. predicate (S) is the subject of that predicate. Thus, by saying that some Arg. of a tr. predicate is subject of its clause, we are effectively claiming that it shares properties with S's of intr. clauses, properties that are moreover not shared by the other argument of the tr. predicate -- i.e. these properties are subject properties (though it should be noted that nothing hinges on the term `subject properties' -- all that is required is similar behavior of S and A as opposed to P, or of S and P as opposed to A). In the prototypical passive, then, the P should share properties with S's that are not shared by A's of the passive construction.English can serve as an excellent illustration of this kind of passive. We can say that in English P's of passive constructions have the full range of morphological and synt. subject properties, the same as S's of intr. predicates.For ERG, it must be the case that at least some properties are common to P and S. However, if we look at the constructions of different lgs that have been considered ergative, we find considerable differences in the extent to which such properties are shared. In some lgs, the shared properties do not extend beyond case marking of NPs. (e.g. in Warlpiri NPs have ERG case marking, however, no other morphological or syntactic properties seem to group S and P together as opposed to A. Even verb agreement operates on a NOM-ACC.* Opposite extreme: lgs like Dyirbal, in whose ERG construction virtually all morphological and syntactic subject properties adhere to the P and not to the A. * To summarize: One feature shared by passive and ERG is the assignment of at least some subject properties to the P of the clause.

  Abstract                 = {The Pirah{\~a}language challenges simplistic application of Hockett's nearly universally accepted design features of human language by showing that some of these features (interchangeability, displacement, and productivity) may be culturally constrained. In particular, Pirah{\~a}culture constrains communication to nonabstract subjects which fall within the immediate experience of interlocutors. This constraint explains a number of very surprising features of Pirah{\~a}grammar and culture: the absence of numbers of any kind or a concept of counting and of any terms for quantification, the absence of color terms, the absence of embedding, the simplest pronoun inventory known, the absence of "relative tenses," the simplest kinship system yet documented, the absence of creation myths and fiction, the absence of any individual or collective memory of more than two generations past, the absence of drawing or other art and one of the simplest material cultures documented, and the fact that the Pirah{\~a}are monolingual after more than 200 years of regular contact with Brazilians and the Tupi-Guarani-speaking Kawahiv.

  Abstract                 = {In this work I contrast passive constructions in two Uto-Aztecan languages: Yaqui and Warih{\'\i}o, members of the Taracahitic sub-branch. These languages behave differently regarding passivization: Yaqui systematically shows a morphological passive with the verbal suffix --wa, whereas Warih{\'\i}o shows a heterogeneous group of passives (tentatively): morphological, periphrastic and notional-functional.},
  Annote                   = {Summarized:Some researchers (Keenan 1985, Haspelmath 1990, Dixon and Aikhenvald 2000)establish a structural feature as the main definitional criterion for a passive, whereas others (Shibatani 1985, Comrie 1988) talk about the vantages and consequences of a approach in terms of prototypes. Even more, Comrie (2003) questions himself about the inappropriateness of the question: ``What is a passive? Shibatani (1985:833) gives primary importance to the defocusing of the agent: ``the defocusing of an agent in the passive is not merely a consequence of an object promotion or of topicalization, but rather is the basic and primary function of the passive construction.''Shibatani lists three facts that support this claim: * passives generally do not express agents overtly, * some lgs avoid the presence of an agent in a passive (e.g. Finnish, Cheremis, Turkish), and * passivization generally does not apply to non-agentive intr. He claims that a clause without an agent or agent-like participant is impossible to passivize since there is no agent to defocus.The necessity of a functional definition of the passive turns evident on investigating lgs such as Warih{\'\i}o given that in this lg we one can find clauses that fulfill the passive definition given by Giv{\'o}n (2004), who defines the passive clause functionally as ``the clause-type whereby the agent of the corresponding active is radically de-topicalized and its patient becomes, by default, the only topical argument'', then the following typology of the cross-linguistically most common major clause-types that perform this function may be obtained. This definition has the characteristic that a passive is obligatorily derived. A more neutral definition is given by Andersen (1991: 111-112): {\^a}{\euro}žThe passive is a transitive construction containing two participants, i.e. an initiator (prototypically an agent) and another (i.e. a `patient') exhibiting the feature [+affected], whereby only the `patient' is specified in the `core' of the clause''.What I want to illustrate by describing all these different accounts is the diversity of criteria on stipulating a passive. Even those approaches that include non-prototypical instances show differences on how they use terms such as `transitivity' and `valency'.Following Shibatani (1985) in his approach to passive, I emphasize that all its features have equal importance, and a construction lacking even one of the features is a non-prototypical instance of a passive.Notesi Shibatani uses the term `agent defocusing' in an attempt to cover different but related phenomena such as the absence of the mention of an agent, mention of an agent in a non-prominent syntactic slot, the blurring of the identity of an agent by the use of plural forms, and the indirect reference to an agent by the use of an oblique case.},

Here we show that this phenomenon is not limited to color: The perception of animal figures (cats and dogs) was more strongly affected by linguistic categories for stimuli presented to the right visual field than those presented to the left. Moreover, the magnitude of the visual field asymmetry was reduced when demands on verbal working memory were increased by a secondary task. This reduction did not occur when the secondary task imposed demands on spatial working memory. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the lateralized Whorf effect may be quite general, reflecting an interaction of linguistic and perceptual codes primarily in the left hemisphere.},

  Abstract                 = {The question of whether language affects perception has been debated largely on the basis of cross-language data, without considering the functional organization of the brain. The nature of this neural organization predicts that, if language affects perception, it should do so more in the right visual field than in the left visual field, an idea unexamined in the debate. Here, we find support for this proposal in lateralized color discrimination tasks. Reaction times to targets in the right visual field were faster when the target and distractor colors had different names; in contrast, reaction times to targets in the left visual field were not affected by the names of the target and distractor colors. Moreover, this pattern was disrupted when participants performed a secondary task that engaged verbal working memory but not a task making comparable demands on spatial working memory. It appears that people view the right (but not the left) half of their visual world through the lens of their native language, providing an unexpected resolution to the language-and-thought debate.},

  Abstract                 = {Members of the Piraha tribe use a "one-two-many" system of counting. I ask whether speakers of this innumerate language can appreciate larger numerosities without the benefit of words to encode them. This addresses the classic Whorfian question about whether language can determine thought. Results of numerical tasks with varying cognitive demands show that numerical cognition is clearly affected by the lack of a counting system in the language. Performance with quantities greater than three was remarkably poor, but showed a constant coefficient of variation, which is suggestive of an analog estimation process.},

  Abstract                 = {The central topic of this study is to investigate three and fourplace predicate in Yaqui, which are characterized by having multiple object arguments. As with other Southern UtoAztecan languages, it has been said that Yaqui follows the Primary/Secondary Object pattern (Dryer 1986). Actually, Yaqui presents three patterns: verbs like nenka `sell' follow the direct-indirect object pattern, verbs like miika `give' follow the primary object pattern, and verbs like chijakta `sprinkle' follow the locative alternation pattern; the primary object pattern is the exclusive one found with derived verbs. This paper shows that the contrast between direct object and primary object languages is not absolute but rather one of degree, and hence two object selection principles are needed to explain this mixed system. The two principles are not limited to Yaqui but are found in other languages as well, including English. },

  Annote                   = {Haspelmath, Martin. 1990. "The grammaticization of passive morphology". Studies in Language 14.1:25-71.p. 25To this almost excessive attention from the point of view of syntax corresponds a relative negligence of the morphological aspects of passive constructions, most importantly the passive marker on the verb (other morphological devices used in passive constructions, such as instrumental or locative markers of agent phrases, are normally not specific to passive constructions and are not considered ?passive morphology? here).Indeed, the passive can be regarded as first and foremost a verbal morphological category whose meaning implies certain changes in the clause structure.p. 26-27Bur first we must ask whether passives are possible without any particular morphological marking. If the passive were basically a syntactic phenomenon, a relation-changing rule analogous to object raising or possessor raising, or a pragmatically-motivated rule like topic fronting or interrogative phrase fronting (?wh-movement?), it would not be unexpected to find passive constructions without special morphology on the verb.Dryer 1982, defending the view that the universal and essential part of the passive is its syntactic property, observes that passive morphology can be of different types (not only auxiliary + participle, but also suffix on the verb, etc.) or even be completely lacking. He concludes that passive morphology is just an accidental fact about individual languages.{\^a}{\euro}ž``Given the following definition of passive constructions:A construction is called passive if:(i) the active subject corresponds either to a non-obligatory oblique phrase or to nothing; and(ii) the active direct object (if any) corresponds to the subject of the passive; and(iii) the construction is somehow restricted vis-{\`a}-vis another unrestricted construction (the active), e.g. less frequent, functionally specialized, not fully productive.I claim that in general passive constructions without passive morphology do not exist.``...The Kinyarwanda construction mentioned by Keenan 1985: 255 does not qualify as a passive because the postverbal agent cannot be omitted and the preposed patient exhibits almost no subject properties. Kimenyi1980:141ff (Keenan?s source) is careful not to call this construction ?passive,? but ?object-subject reversal.?p. 32In many lgs, the gr. Morphemes that mark the passive are not restricted to this function but can have other uses, such as reflexive, reciprocal, ancticausative and potential passive. ? The question now is whether any pattern can be discerned in the distribution of this uses.p. 595.4 The basic functions of the passiveIt has been long recognized that the two main functions of the passive are the foregrounding (or topicalization) of the patient and the backgrounding of the agent (e.g. Gabelentz 1861:{\S}2, with references to earlier work). And just as old is probably the question of which of these two functions is the dominating one. Among recent functionalist studies, Givon 1979 emphasizes the topicalization function, whereas Shibatani 1985 takes ?agent defocusing? as the main function of the passive. In the relational syntactic debates of the 70s, Perlmutter and Postal 1977analyzed passives as advancement of the initial direct object to subject, whereas Comrie 1977 favored an analysis where the initial subject is demoted spontaneously. And going back to the earlier part of this century, Brugmann took topicalization as the main function of the passive, whereas Meillet considered the agent backgrounding function more important.},

  Abstract                 = {Proponents of a self-identified 'relativist' view of cross-language color naming have confounded two questions: (1) Is color naming largely subject to local linguistic convention? and (2) Are cross-language color naming differences reflected in comparable differences in color cognition by their speakers? The 'relativist' position holds that the correct answer to both questions is Yes, based on data from the Berinmo language of Papua New Guinea. It is shown here that the Berinmo facts instead support a more complex view -- that cross-language color naming follows non-trivial universal tendencies, while cross-language color-naming differences do indeed correlate with differences in color cognition. The rhetoric of 'relativity' versus 'universalism' impedes understanding of cross-language color naming and cognition.},

  Abstract                 = {1.1. Voice and voice systems: basicness and some basic concepts p. 26[{\ldots}]For several years, many linguists have been interested in the typology of case and case systems including, for example, the comparative properties of ergative-absolutive and nominative-accusative systems. These two types of system differ from one another according to the patterns by which case is assigned to the core (essential) arguments of transitive and intransitive sentences (these arguments being subject and object for transitive, subject alone for intransitives). Both types of system commonly embody devices for reorganizing the assignment of core grammatical relations to particular thematic roles (or to the arguments bearing these roles) . For instance, the name `passive' is applied to a device of this variety commonly found in accusative languages; `antipassive' is considered the counterpart to passive in ergative case systems. Such devices relate classes of sentences and are often viewed as derivational processes. The basis for their existence varies from language to language; in some systems (`role-dominated' languages in the parlance of Foley and Van Valin, 1984) their motivation is syntactic/semantic; in others (Foley and Van Valin's `reference-dominated' systems) their motivation is attributed to discourse and pragmatic factors. In many languages, of course, syntactic and discourse factors both playa role in processes of this sort. Whatever their motivation, these devices are usually regarded as rearranging the basic syntactic organization of a sentence, i.e., as interchanging the grammatical relations of arguments representing certain roles. In accusative languages, as mentioned above, certain processes which have this effect are said to represent `passivization'. What happens under passivization is usually viewed in one of two ways.In the simplest scheme, Agent is the role normally borne by grammatical subjects in nonderived sentences (Keenan, 1976b); sentences which have agentive subjects are said to be in the active voice'; and ``sentences in nonactive voices ... are to be derived by promoting to subject (position) various non-subject constituents of active sentences {\ldots} .'' (Keenan, 1976a:255). Grammatical voice, according to this view, is a system for moving arguments `representing nonagential thematic relations into subject position. A limitation of this analysis is, of course, that few (if any) languages restrict subjects of nonderived sentences to the Agent role.Rather than treating Agent as a role basic to subject, a more sophisticated approach to sentence derivation might be taken by viewing Agent as the prototypical subject thematic role. Suppose one has a scheme under which verbs (or verbal concepts) are grouped into several well defined semantic classes. (For examples of such schemata see Dik, 1980:53; and see Foley and Van Valin, 1984:40ff., who use a classification scheme attributed to Dowty and Vendler.) If one adopts some such scheme, a different thematic role can be ascribed to basic subjects for each verb class. Agent then furnishes the prototype of `basic subject'; i.e., as Agent is the role basic to subject in verb class A, so another thematic role is basic to subject in *class B, and so on. (One can simplify the scheme by taking all the roles basic to the subjects of the different verb classes and assigning them to a single macrocategory, such as Foley and Van Valin's `actor' macroroles.) Then the passive can be seen essentially as a process for moving thematic arguments in and out of sentential subject position. In other words, passive relates two classes of sentences: one class in which the thematic role borne by the subject corresponds to the Agent prototype; and another class of sentences in which the thematic role borne by the subject does not. Once processes like passive (and their counterparts in nonaccusative systems) are defined in this way, one can proceed to working out their expressive, pragmatic and syntactic functions. Much recent research in theoretical grammar has been taken up with these issues. The present essay, however, is principally concerned with the typology of subject's relation to sententially expressed situations in basic, not derived, sentences. In various languages, subjects of nonderived sentences seem to be permitted to have either of two conceptual statuses. I shall refer to these statuses in the present essay as `controller' and `affected entity', Again, in various languages, a formal alternation in verbal morphology indicate which of the two statuses is borne by the sentential subject. In this essay, I all refer to such alternate forms as diathesis, and the system to which they pertain I shall refer to as voice.The notions Controller and affected entity might be clarified by a comparison with the concepts actor and undergoer introduced by Foley and Van Valin, 1984. It has been observed that Foley and Van Valin define actor as a macrorole, i.e., as a concept superordinate to relations like Agent, Instrument, Goal and so forth. Thus the italicized items in (1a-e) below are classified as actors (p. 30), although each represents a distinct thematic relation. Analogously, Foley and Van Valin suggest that there is a macrorole which furnishes the prototype of basic object, namely the undergoer macrorole; thus they (ibid.) classify each italicized role in (2a-e) below as an undergoer. [{\ldots}]In the present essay I shall use the undergoer macrorole notion of Foley and Van Valin, but a concept `affected entity' is to be introduced as well. It is distinct from undergoer, since affected entity is not a thematic relation; rather, it is a conceptual status (like `controller', which will be considered shortly). Affected entity status can accrue to arguments representing various thematic relations, and in fact it can converge with either macrorole posited by Foley and Van Valin, actor or undergoer, upon a single sentential argument. This will be clarified in the body of the essay.In the essay I also refer to `controller', a conceptual status distinct from the macrothematic concept actor. The latter will be more often referred to below by the term `source', indicating the argument to whose participation onces can attribute the eventuality represented in a sentence -- i.e., that argument in whose absence killing would not have taken place in (1a), shattering in (1b), receiving in (1e), sensing in (1d), emitting in (1e), throwing in (2a) and so on. I agree with Foley and Van Valin's positing some such macrorole, but dissent from their attributing the conceptual status `controller' to the actor (source) macrorole exclusively. That is, the principal difference between my scheme and Foley and van Valin's lies in the absolute distinction they draw between actors and undergoers; the two macroroles cannot converge upon a single argument in the same sentence. For instance, Foley and Van Valin identify the underlined argument in (1d) above as an actor; it cannot also represent an undergoer. However, according to the scheme of this essay, the argument in question is both an actor (or source) and an affected entity.By affected entity is meant the participant perceived as affected or most affected in consequence of the sententially denoted action (= situation). An affected entity may undergo action but need not do so; in some languages, as we will see, an entity can be perceived as affected in virtue of performing, not undergoing, certain actions. Conversely, while controller conceptual status is ordinarily associated with actors, it may accrue to undergoers in some systems (see Section 4 below). By way of a working definition, controller status can be ascribed to the argument whose participation is seen as determining the course and/or outcome of a sententially denoted action. A later part of this essay, Section 5, is devoted to discussing further the definition and universal /particular manifestations of the conceptual status of controller. Overall, the essay will show that not only do conceptual statuses (controller, affected entity) and particular thematic/macrothematic relations sometimes converge, but that conditions and constraints on their convergence define a typology of voice systems.p. 291.2. Scope of the study As stated above, this essay is not principally coned with processes like passive and antipassive. The effects of these processes are often signalled in verbal morphology by derivational markers, and are sometimes accounted for in terms of sentence-deriving rules. This is why these processes are referred to in the present essay by the term `derived voice'. However, no prejudice is intended to analyses in which passives, antipassives, etc., are base-generated, or otherwise not accounted for by some formal process operating on `basic' syntactic/semantic structures (see fn. 2). `Derived voice' is simply intended here to mean processes, like passive and antipassive, that can be analyzed in terms of sentence derivation (whether the individual analyst chooses to do so or not is beside the point) . In applying the term `voice' to such processes, it is easy for the analyst to overlook the fact that the same term usually refers to a very different class of phenomena in traditional grammar. In fact, the use of the term `voice' in reference to sentence-deriving processes (i.e., regular formal relationships among classes of sentences) is a fairly recent innovation. A traditional grammarian, Jespersen, 1965:164ff., has presented a detailed discussion of the relation of active and passive constructions in English while explicitly maintaining that this relation is not one of `voice'. Rather, he treats active and passive as formally related sentence types, in contrast to voice oppositions as found in classical languages, e.g., active and middle in Greek and Sanskrit ([{\ldots}]). In the present essay, to distinguish active/middle and similar systems from `derived voice', the term `basic voice' is introduced. This term denotes a type of relation encoded in verbal morphology (i.e., through diathesis), signalling which of several alternative conceptual statuses is borne by the sentential subject. Basic voice oppositions are not analyzable in derivational terms (i.e., in terms of a rule for relating one class of sentences to another). [{\ldots}][{\ldots}]p. 30It seems to me that the goal of a better understanding of the relations between basic voice systems and derived voice processes is a worthy starting point for a general program of research. The present essay is intended to contribute to the research program in two principal ways: (i) by offering an account of several different voice systems within a single descriptive framework; (ii) by proposing a rudimentary scheme of typological classification for basic voice systems (Section 6). In addition, Section 5 offers some speculations on how voice systems may relate to a variety of other mechanisms for encoding a particular semantic function, the expression of control (a parameter whose significance will be increasingly apparent in Sections 2-4 below). [{\ldots}]As hinted in Section 1.1. above, a major claim of this essay is that the conceptual status of sentential arguments plays a role in the organization of (basic) voice systems. A good starting point for justifying this claim might be in noting that the concept of voice is often explained in exactly this way in traditional grammars, particularly in descriptions of classical Indo-European languages. Many of these descriptions more or less explicitly treat diathesis (verbal voice marking) as a means of encoding a distinction in views of sententially denoted action, a distinction having to do with the subject referent's conceptual status -- its perceived relationship to the action's effects. Lyons, 1968:363, summarizing the respective functions of active and middle (mediopassive) voice in Latin, Greek, and other classical Indo-European languages, alludes to this distinction. He remarks that, whereas the active verb expresses a view of the subject as an Agent or doer of the sententially denoted action, the use of middle voice is to mark situations in which ``the `action' or `state' affects the subject of the verb or his interests.'' (emphasis added) The following section presents some illustrations of middle voice functions in two classical languages. This will be a useful preliminary to our later survey of other languages, some of which have not been traditionally thought of as voice-embodying languages. p. 312. VOICE FUNCTIONS IN CLASSICAL INDO-EUROPEAN 2.1. Classical Greek In classical Greek most conjugations of the verb require the marking of the active/middle distinction. A typical function of the middle in Greek is to indicate an identity relation between the subject (or more properly, the source argument) and the direct object (or more properly, the undergoer). That is, a middle voice verb may convey reflexive or reciprocal activity. Examples, (3a-c) below (from Barber, 1975) illustrate this function. Another middle voice function, referred to by Barber as the ``plain middle'', is that of showing the subject's beneficiary status vis-{\`a}-vis the action; i.e., for conveying the subject's dual status, as source (performer) of the action and as affected entity, or locus of the action's effects. Illustrations (again, from Barber) are provided in (4-5).[{\ldots}]p. 32Several additional functions of Greek middle voice are outlined by Smyth (1974). One of these (for which an appropriate designation might be `nucleonic middle') involves the expression of action in which the undergoer can be seen as, in some way, within the ``sphere'' (Smyth's terminology) of the Subject. Thus the middle is used when the undergoer, is the property of -- or belongs to -- the Subject (`wash one's hands', `give one's vote'); when the undergoer moves into the sphere of the Subject (`to send for a thing'); or when' the undergoer moves out of the sphere of --the Subject (`sell', i.e., `give a thing for one's `profit'; `deliver a speech'). Another typical use of Greek middle voice is for expressing the disposition of the Subject. In other words, there is a preference for middle diathesis when effects logically accrue to no party but the Subject. This function is especially typical of deponent. Middle verbs (Smyth, p.. 393). Some of these verbs denote bodily or physical disposition, i.e., `jump', `fly', `dance', etc.; others denote emotive or mental disposition, i.e., `perceive', `wish', `consider', `lament', etc. Apart from the deponent (disposition-expressing) function, middle voice generally seems to be selected over active in Greek where the action's effects, good or ii, accrue to the Subject; thus middle is the typical diathesis of verbs such as `marry', `make peace', etc.According to Smyth (ibid., p. 390) the middle voice in Greek indicates broadly that the action is performed with `special reference' to the subject. The various middle voice functions outlined above suggest that this special reference involves an identity between the source of action and the entity principally affected thereby. There is, though, one further function of middle diathesis in Greek and in lE generally (the `passive' middle function). Discussion of which will be deferred to the end of the following outline of voice in classical Sanskrit. p. 332.2. Classical Sanskrit Traditional Sanskrit grammars use the terms {\=a}tmane-pada and parasmaipada, respectively, to refer to middle and active diathesis. The terms {\=a}tmane and parasmai literally mean `for oneself' and `for another', while pada means `term' or `word'. Evidently, then, the early Sanskrit grammarians conceived of diathesis as the marking of a conceptual distinction between actions whose effects bear principally on their sources, and actions whose effects bear principally on arguments other than their sources. Commentary on the functions of the two diatheses in the early Sanskrit grammar attributed to P{\=a}{\d n}ini tends to confirm this. It also reveals the close similarity of verbal voice functions in Sanskrit to those of classical Greek. [{\ldots}]p. 716. THE TYPOLOGY OF VOICE: CONCLUSIONS Processes of subject derivation, or derived voice, have been distinguished in this essay from voice alternations in nonderived sentences, or basic voice. Basic voice has been seen as a system for marking identity or non-identity of the sentential subject with the conceptual status of affected entity. The distinction is encoded on sentential verbs through nonderivational morphological alternations in verbal bases; i.e., diathesis. p. 72Affected entity is neither a grammatical nor a thematic relation; it is a conceptual status which may be assigned to arguments representing certain thematic roles. Specifically, affected entity status may devolve upon either of the essential or core arguments of transitive sentence structures, source (actor) or undergoer. Affected entity is closely related to another conceptual status, that of control, i.e., locus of control over sententially denoted action. The determination of controller is highly viable cross-linguistically, although it frequently plays a role in basic subject selection (sometimes in combination with the actor macrorole). But however controller is defined , and however it functions in any particular system, it is hypothesized that affected entity will be defined in that system in terms of the notion control. That is, affected entity in any system represents the locus of maximum effective or potential control over verbally denoted action. This testable hypothesis is the major result of the present investigation and is intended as a foundation hypothesis for future research on voice systems and their typology. From this hypothesis it follows that affected entities in any basic voice system will have just the semantic properties associated with controllers. Therefore, affected entity, will converge or not with the macrorole notion actor (source) just to the degree that controller status tends to converge with Source in the particular system. Among the languages surveyed in this essay, for instance, Tamil shows a strong tendency for basic subject to represent the convergence of source thematic role and controller status; likewise, affected entity status accrues only to source-subjects in Tamil basic sentences. At the other extreme, Korean and Navajo show little if any tendency for source and controller to converge on any one grammatical relation in sentence structures. Rather, controller status combines with either of the core thematic relations in transitive structures to create the either of the core thematic relations in transitive structures to create the sentential subject; and affected entity status, too, can devolve upon either of those two thematic relations in subject position.It seems, then, that an illuminating typological schema for voice systems can be constructed upon a scale, of core thematic relation-affected entity identities. This is shown in (52) below, which places the major languages surveyed in this paper in an ordered ranking according to a scale of affected entity-macrorole identities:p. 73Among the languages surveyed in the essay it is close to9 the X-extreme that one would place Tamil, as a language in which affected entity invariably has the thematic role of source (actor). Proceeding toward the Y-end of the scale we next have classical lE systems. In these languages there is a convergence of affected entity and source thematic role much of the time, but not always; e.g., not in the catalytic and passive functions of the affective (i.e., middle) voice. Closer to the Y-end of the scale we find the next system, Korean. Only in relatively rare instances (such as ex. 43 above) can undergoer and affected entity be seen as not strictly coinciding in this language. At the far Y-extreme of the scale, lastly, we have systems like Navajo, in which, evidently, all affected subjects are also undergoers. It deserves mention in closing that a hierarchical scale defined by actor and undergoer at its two extremes, the Actor/Undergoer hierarchy, is proposed by Foley and Van Valin, 1984:59. They do so in order to explain cross-language tendencies for certain pragmatic and thematic relations to converge in sentential functional structure. It may be a tribute to the accuracy and elegance of the scale they set up that it seems to find confirmation in the typology of voice systems. },

  Abstract                 = {Many languages have no basic color term for "blue." Instead, they call short-wavelength stimuli "green" or "dark". We show that this cultural, linguistic phenomenon could result from accelerated aging of the eye because of high, chronic exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) in sunlight (e.g., phototoxic lens brunescence). Reviewing 203 world languages, we found a significant relationship between UV dosage and color naming: In low-UV localities, languages generally have the word "blue"; in high-UV areas, languages without "blue" prevail. Furthermore, speakers of these non-"blue" languages often show blue-yellow color vision deficiency. We tested our phototoxicity hypothesis in a color-naming experiment, using computerized, colorimetric simulations of Munsell colors as viewed through clear and brunescent lenses. As predicted, our young subjects used "blue" as in English when the simulated lens was clear, but named colors as in tropical languages when the lens was dense. Our within-subjects design precludes a cultural explanation for this result.},

  Abstract                 = {An influential claim in the child language literature posits that children use structural cues in the input language to acquire verb meaning (Gleitman, 1990). One such cue is the of arguments co-occurring with the verb, which provides an indication as to the event type associated with the verb (Fisher, 1995). In some languages however (e.g. Hindi), verb arguments are ellipted relatively freely, subject to certain discourse-pragmatic constraints. In this paper, we address three questions: Is the pervasive argument ellipsis characteristic of adult Hindi also found in Hindi-speaking caregivers' ? If so, do children consequently make errors in verb transitivity? How early do children learning a split-ergative language, such as Hindi, exhibit sensitivity to discourse-pragmatic influences on argument realization? We show that there is massive argument ellipsis in caregivers' input to 3-4 year-olds. However, children acquiring Hindi do not make transitivity errors in their own speech. Nor do they elide arguments randomly. Rather, even at this early age, children appear to be sensitive to discourse-pragmatics in their own spontaneous speech production. These findings in a split-ergative language parallel patterns of argument realization found in children acquiring both nominative-accusative languages (e.g. Korean) and ergative-absolutive languages (e.g. Tzeltal, Inuktitut).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper focuses on three questions relating to Western Malayo-Polynesian syntactic typology. Two are general questions concerned with relevant syntactic theory; the first questions the formal differences between passive and ergative constructions and some of the difficulties that arise in distinguishing the two types of construction are discussed. Secondly the usefulness or otherwise of answering the first question is examined. The third question specifically addresses whether or not a Western Malayo-Polynesian language of Northern Sumatra, Karo Batak, is typologically ergative-like or whether the construction type that might be interpreted as ergative is in fact a passive.1 },

This suffix is inserted as a last resort where UG makes the assignment of case to the object (transitive aspectless embedded clauses) and the extraction of the subject with ergative agreement (aspectual main clauses) otherwise impossible. Therefore, this notion cannot be restricted to instances of movement, as in Chomsky (1994). Rather, it must also include lexical insertion of affixal material in the deriva- tion, as in the broader view found in Chomsky (1991). },

(Palmer 1986: 2-7).It can be said that the basic functions of the passive are the promotion of the Patient (or non-Agent) and the demotion or deletion of the Agent (but see 6.7). This does not involve the acceptance of a particular syntactic theory, but merely implies that the functions of the roles of Agent, Patient etc. in the passive can be accounted for in terms of variation from their functions in the active sentence.It is the recognition that the Agent is the Subject and the Patient is the Object in the active sentence and that the active is the basic construction (see 3.1), white the Patient (or non-Agent) is the Subject and the Agent has peripheral status or is absent in the passive sentence, that makes it possible to talk about the promotion of the Patient to Subject and the demotion or deletion of the Agent. As already argued, the passive must have some formal marking, and it seems generally true. That there is marking on the verb. Haspelmath (1990: 267) argues that the are no passive constructions without passive verbal morphology, but, provided `verbal morphology' is used widely to include clitics, this may be no more than a part of the definition of passive rather than an empirical observation.p. 1195.2 Promotion of Object There are some verbs in English that do not appear to have passives, e.g. HAVE (in the sense of possession) and RESEMBLE. This is also true of CONTAIN in a stative sense, but not in a dynamic sense. Equal1y, verbs such as WEIGH May passivize when their `objects' refer to the items weighed, but not to the measurement: One way of dealing with this problem is to say that the NP after the verb is not an Object. Apart from the lack of passivization, the arguments are Dot notional1y patients, but locatives or terms of measurement (often called `adjuncts').However, that is not an entirely valid argument, since, as will be seen in 5.3, promotion by passivization is not a test of `Object-hood'. It might be more appropriate to recognize another type of (grammatical) argument, which occupies the place of the Object with an active verb, yet is (a) not affected by passivization, and (b) does not have the notional role of patient. However, if availability for promotion is taken to establish such NPs as o objects, there is considerable variation in languages in respect of the notional roles of the NPs that may function as Objects. Thus, in Arabic both temporal and locative NPs are marked morphologically as Objects and can be promoted to Subject by passivization (Davison 1980: 51-2):p. 121ln Kinyarwanda (Bantu) all kinds of notional roles may be similarly identified as Objects. Unlike their translational equivalents in English, the verbs `have', `weigh' etc. an have passives; `have' is exemplified in (Kimenyi 1980: 127f): Similar, but more surprising, perhaps are the passives in (Kimenyi 1988: 361f):Umug{\'o}re a-rwaa-ye um{\'u}twe Woman she-be.sick-ASP headache `The woman has a headache' Um{\'u}twe u-rwaa-w-e n'{\^u}mug{\'o}re headache it-be.sick-PASS-ASP by woman `It is the woman that bas a headache' Umug{\'o}re y-{\'a}-b{\'a}a-ye perezida woman she-PST-be-ASP president `The woman became president' Perezida y-a-baa-w-e n'{\^u}mug{\'o}represident he-PST-be-PASS-ASP by woman `It is the woman who became president' Umugabo a-ra-geend-a ijoro man he-PRS-travel-ASP night `The man is travelling in the night'Ijoro ri-ra-geend-w-a n'{\^u}mugabo night it-PRS-travel-PASS-ASP by man `Is the man who is travelling in the night'(Kimenyi does not explain why he uses the translations beginning with `It is the woman/man who{\ldots}'; the obvious implication is that the Agent is focused by passivization.) He notes that `all semantic roles, patients, datives, benefactives, manners, instrumentals, goals, locatives, temporals, attributives . . . , function as direct objects'. Often a verb has what seem to be two Objects (including the types just discussed) and either may be promoted:Umugaanga a-ru-vuur-a umug{\'o}re ink{\^o}r{\'o}ra doctor he-PRS-cure-ASP woman cough `The doctor is treating the woman's cough' Umug{\'o}re a-ra-vuur-w-a {\'\i}nk{\^o}r{\'o}ra n'{\^u}mugaanga woman she-PRS-cure-PASS-ASP cough by doctor `*The woman is being treated the cough by the doctor' ink{\^o}r{\'o}ra i-ra-yuur-w-a umug{\'o}re n'{\^u}mugaanga cough it-PRS-cure-PASS-ASP woman by doctor `*The cough is being treated woman by the doctor' Treating these in terms of constructions with two Objects entails the recognition of the construction Subject + Object + Object as well as the usual tr. Subject+ Object. It might be claimed that these are not Objects but various kinds of oblique relations. There are two arguments against this: they are not formally distinguished from Objects `proper' in any way, {\ldots} Kinyarwanda has oblique relations (Dative, Instrumental and Locative) that are formally marked as such and can be also promoted to Subject (but see 6.6.2).There is equally no evidence to suggest that, when there are two Objects, they can be distinguished as primary and secondary Objects (2.4, but see 6.6.2). Another language that has a construction with two Objects, either of which may be promoted, is Tigrinya (Ethiopian Semitic, personal research), but this occurs only with the verb `give': There is another construction with two Objects in Tigrinya, but only one of them may be promoted. This is the construction in which the second Object indicates a part of the body and the first is marked as animate. Only the Object marked as animate may be promoted: (There is a similar construction in Korean -- see 5.6.) Rather different are the passives in English exemplified by (see Palmer 1987: 215ff.):The daughter looked after the old man The old man was looked after by the daughterIn the active the old man seems to be part of a prepositional phrase, but, obviously, look after is treated as a single verb with the old man as its object. Similar passives are possible with idioms such as do away with, get rid off, put up with. But passivization is possible with some combinations of verb plus preposition, even though there is no such idiomaticity: This hat has been sat on.The bed has been slept in.Finally, it should be noted that even if a lg bas a passive, not all Objects/Patients can be promoted to Subject. Thus it was seen in 2.2 that in Korean the passive Subject must be `in general, animate and conscious'. Objects that do{\^A}{\textperiodcentered} not have these characteristics cannot be promoted. p. 1255.3 Promotion of oblique terms Although the Patient-Object is the tern most commonly promoted to Subject, in some lgs terms other than Objects, oblique terms, may also be promoted. The Beneficiary-Dative is often promoted (and it is relevant to note that the Beneficiary was often the promoted term in the double Object constructions of 5.2), An example from Japanese is (Song 1987: 75):{\ldots}Whether this is also true of English (as the translation given above might suggest) is discussed in 6.6. More strikingly, Malagasy has a passive voice, but also a `circumstantial' voice, which promotes both the Beneficiary-Dative and the Instrumental. Examples (Keenan 1972: 172- 3): The verb form indicates whether the Subject is the Agent, the Patient or one of the oblique terms, and the Subject appears in final position. The promoted Subjects (`the rice', `the children', `the money') also have the syntactic characteristics of Subjects in that they may function as pivots. They are used as heads of relative clauses, and it may be recalled that in Malagasy it is only Subjects that can be relativised:{\ldots} A very different language that cao also promote either the Object or the Instrumental is Kwakwala (Wakashan, British Columbia, Levine 1980: 241, Anderson 1985: 166). Examples are (the glosses are from Anderson, and notice that the suffixes on the NPs indicate the relation of the following NP):n{\'E}{\texttrademark}p'id-i-da g{\'E}{\texttrademark}nan{\'E}{\texttrademark}m-x{\`I}{\textsterling}a guk{\^E}{\textperiodcentered}-sa t'is{\'E}{\texttrademark}mthrow-SUBJ-ART child-OBJ house-INSTR rock `The child hit the house with a rock by throwing' (`The child threw a rock at the house') n{\'E}{\texttrademark}p'id-su?-i-da guk{\^E}{\textperiodcentered}-sa ganan-sa t'is{\'E}{\texttrademark}mthrow-SU?-SUBJ-ART house-INSTR child-INSTR rock`The house was hit by a rock thrown by the child' n{\'E}{\texttrademark}p'id-ayu-i-da t'is{\'E}{\texttrademark}m xa guk{\^E}{\textperiodcentered}-sa g{\'E}{\texttrademark}nan{\'E}{\texttrademark}mthrow-ayu-SUBJ-ART rock-OBJ house-INSTR child `The rock was what the child threw at the hause' eThe rock was . used for throwing at the house by the child')As with Malagasy, there are two different types of passive, one for the promotion of the Object, the other for the promotion of the oblique with markers -su?- and -ayu respectively. Levine, in fact, argues against a passive interpretation in favour of one in terms of `focus', but the constructions contain typical passive features, although it is, indeed, the case that there is some similarity between the systems of Malagasy and Kwakw'ala and those of `topic' lgs to be discussed in 6.4. p. 1275.4 Impersonal and `affected' passives In a number of languages there are passives of intransitive verbs; examples from Latin, German and Dutch are: Es wurde im Nebenzimmer geredet. It is almost certain, however, that this type of passive is restricted to what might be called `agentive' verbs (see 3.5.4) or what Perlmutter (1978) calls `unergative', where the single term S is an agent, .as contrasted with `unaccusative', where S is essentially a patient. Perlmutter and Postal (1984: 144) give an example from Welsh with the verb `dance', but note that Welsh does Dot permit the passivization of `grow': The simplest explanation for the fact that generally it is agentive intransitive verbs that are passivized may be round in Shibatani's suggestion (see the discussion in 6.7) that the primary function of the passive is defocusing' :which includes deletion) of the agent. Generally it is the Agent-Subject of transitives that is demoted or deleted; with intransitives is similarly deleted or demoted, but only if it is an agent.Alternatively, it might also be noted that these agentive verbs have unexpressed `cognate' Objects ('fight a flight, `dance a dance' etc), and that in English, one can `have a fight / whistle/a dance / a swim', but not `*have a grow / a drown'; notionally at least, these cognate objects might be considered to be the unexpressed Subjects of the passives (`(A fight) was fought' etc.); there is even some grammatical evidence for this in the constructions with the impersonal (`it') Subject, which might suggest the promotion of an unexpressed `it' (the cognate object) in the active.Impersonal passives are also round with verbs that have a second argument that is not marked as Object, but as an oblique term (the oblique term is not promoted, as in the examples of 5.3). Thus in Latin INVIDEO (`envy') is followed by the dative, not the accusative, but it has a passive (with the dative NP unchanged): The same is true of German:seine Freunde halfen ihm his friends helped him.DAT `His friends helped him' Ihm wurde von seinen Freunden geholfen him.DAT became by bis friends helped`He was helped by his friends.'{\ldots}There is a similar situation in Icelandic, where some verbs are followed by le dative, others by the genitive (Andrews 1982: 466-7):{\~A}{\textthreequarters}eir bj{\"o}rgu{\~A}{\textdegree}u st{\'u}lkunni they rescued girl.DAT `They rescued the girl' st{\'u}lkunni var bjarga{\~A}{\textdegree} girl.DAT was rescued `The girl was rescued' vi{\~A}{\textdegree} vitj{\~A}{\textdegree}um {\'O}lafs we visited Olaf.GEN `We visited Olaf.'{\'O}lafs var vitja{\~A}{\textdegree}Olaf.GEN was visited `Olaf was visited' Syntactically, the dative or genitive NP in the passive may function as a pivot, and is thus `treated as another example of `dative subject' (Andrews 1985: 122, but see the discussion in 4.3): M{\'e}r var hj{\'a}lpa{\~A}{\textdegree} I.DAT was helped `I helped' min var vitja{\~A}{\textdegree} I.GEN was visited `I was visited' {\'E}g vonast tH ao vera hj{\^a}lpao/vitjao 1 hope towards to be helped/visited `1 hope to be helped' _ (But Andrews 1982: 467 says that the last sentence is 4questionable for many speakers' .) . The issue is made more complex by the fact that, in sorne languages, there appear to be impersonal passives of transitive verbs, in which the Patient remains in the Object position and is not promoted to Subject, e.g. in Irish (Keenan 1985: 275): Bhuail si e Hit she him `She hit him' Buaileadh (lei) e Hit + IMPERS PASS (with ber) him `She was hit by him' {\ldots}:i. Song notes that there is a similar construction in Korean, but with a difference in that in the active the possessor may be indicated either in the gentive or, apparently, as a second Object (see 5.2): John-in ai-ii/IiI son-il jab-ossta n-TOP Child-GENjACC hand-Acc catch-PAST John grasped the child's band/the child by the band' Ai-nin John-ege son-il jab-hi-ossta Child-TOP John-DAT hand-Acc catch-PASS-PAST Rhe child was subjected to John's grasping his hand' (`The child's hand was held by John'?) Here it might appear that the passive is derived by simply promoting the second Object, but the first Object (`hand') cannot be similarly promoted, so that it may be simpler to treat this in the same way as the previous sentence, Le. As an adversity passive. 5.5 Passives and topicalization It is wise to exclude change of word order alone as a marker of the passive, even though word order is often the only formaI distinction between Subject and Object (and in English it is the most important feature, and the only one that is always present). The reason for excluding word order is that in many lgs it is used, independently of passivization, for the purpose of topicalization. Thus, even in English an Object may be placed in initial position for that purpose: This is not, however, restricted to Objects or even to NPs: Intelligent, he is not.{\ldots}It May also be added that in Greek and English, it does not acquire pivot status. There are, however, marginal and debatable cases. For instance, it was seen in 4.1.1 that in Lango it is the topicalized NP that controls deletion in coordination, but this topicalization is not accompanied by any markers on the verb, and it is the Subject that controls reflexives (4.1.4). ln any case, as was argued in 4.3, pivots should not be used as evidence for Subjects, and, a fortiorithey are not evidence for passivization. Another example of a construction about which there has been disagreement is to be found in Acehneset to be discussed in 6.2. A little more problematic is the situation in Kinyarwanda (Bantu, Kimenyi 1988: 357-8).This language has passives (discussed in 5.2 and 5.3), but it also has a device for interchanging Subject and Object, but with the additional point that the Object, when moved into Subject position, is the argument that agrees with the verb: abag{\'o}re ba-a-ri b{\^a}-teet-se ib{\'\i}shy{\'\i}imbo women they-PST-be they-cook-ASP beans `The women were cooking beans' (Kimenyi 1988: 358)object-subject reversal:ib{\'\i}shy{\'\i}imbo by-aa-ri b{\^\i}-teet-se abag{\'o}re beans they-PST-be they-cook-ASP women `The beans were being cooked by the women.' (Kimenyi 1988: 358)Agreement with the verb is shown by the prefixes glossed by Kimenyi as `they'; in the first sentence they are appropriate to the class that includes `woman', in the second, to the class that includes `beans'. Kimenyi translates the second as if it were passive, rather than as `The beans, the women cooked', but it is better treated as a topicalization device rather than a passive, not only because Kinyarwanda has a quite different passive, but, more irnportantly, because there is, again, no passive marker on the verb. It was noted in 2.6 for Chichewa, another Bantu lg, that even locatives may be placed in initial position and agree with the verb. Although agreement marking of topicalized arguments is typologically unusual, these sentences in Kinyarwanda are better treated as examples of topicalization than of passivization. Alternatively, perhaps, an absolute distinction between passivization and topicalization should not be drawn; these constructions of Kinyarwanda have one of the marks of the passive, but lack the more crucial passive marking on the verb.Another problematic case is provided by Palauan (W. Austronesian, Foley and Van Valin 1985: 316-17). Here what appears to be a passive involves interchange of the positions of Agent and Patient and a set of special prefixes on the verb that agree with the passive Agent. (There is agreement with the Patient in both active and passive, but not, apparently with the agent of the active.) Examples are: a {\^E}”ad a mos-terir a ngalek ART man see-3pl.HUM ART child `The man saw the children' a ngalek a le-bos-terir a {\^E}”ad ART child PASS.3sg-see-3PL.HUM ART man `The children were seen by the man' Even oblique terms may, apparently, be promoted: a ngelek-ek a sme{\^E}”er er a tereter ART child-my sick.INTR with ART cold `My child is sick with a cold' a tereter a l-se{\^E}”er er ngiy a ngelek-ek ART cold PASS.3sg-sick with 3SG ART child-my `With a cold is being sick by my child' (`A cold is being sick with by my child'.)However, these are more like examples of topicalization than of passive: the Patient-Object unaffected and there is, therefore, no evidence that it is promoted to subject, and it is not abvious that the special prefix signaIs demotion of the Agent, since with demotion agreement is usually lost, not gained -- it may be that the function of the prefix is merely to make the status of the Agent-Subject explicit, because it has been moved from the usual Subject position. However, relativization on the Patient requires this `passive': a le-bos-terir a {\^E}”ad el ngalek ART PASS.3sg-see-3plHUM ART man REL child `The children which were seen by the man' It is not possible to say: *a {\^E}”ad a mos-terir el ngalek ART man see-3pl.HUM REL child `the children which the man saw'This rather looks like an example of passivization being used to promote the Patient-Object to Subject in a lg which permits relativization on Subjects only (see 4.6). Yet, this merely establishes a syntactic pivot and, as was argued in 4.3 pivots should not necessarily be equated with Subjects. There is a rather different problem in Dinka ( T. Andersen 1991), where there are two constructions, both of which have features of passives, as exemplified by (subscripted markers of creaky and breatby voice have been omitted): {\ldots}p. 1365.6 Functions of the passive (i) It promotes a non-Subject to Subject position to make it available as a ' syntactic pivot. This use has already been discussed in sorne detail (4.6). (ii) Closely associated with this, especially with the use of pivots in coordination, is the promotion of a non-Agent for topicalization. (iii) The passive is often used, with the agent omitted, where the Agent is unknown, non-specific or unimportant.(iv) ln some lgs the passive is used because there are restrictions, in terms of animacy/agency etc., on the type of entity that may function as the Subject of an active verbe Thus, according to Trithart (1979 -- see 4.6), passives are favoured in Bantu lgs if they promote to Subject an NP higher on a scale involving human/animate/inanimate. Conversely, as was noted in 2.2, a strong preference for animate Subjects may block the passive ln Korean, as in the example quoted by Song: John-{\'E}¨n k{\'E}¨ sakwa-l{\'E}¨l m{\v o}g-{\v o}ssta John-TOP the apple-ACC eat-PST`John ate the apple' * k{\'E}¨ sakwa-n{\'E}¨n John-ege m{\v o}g-{\v o}sstathe apple-TOP John-DAT eat-PASS-PST `The apple was eaten by John'Klaiman (1988) argues that the issue in Korean is not one of animacy, but of control. She offers (p. 61), using a different transcription from that of Song, the examples: Id yAca-ka cA salamli tIN-ll kIlk-Assta That Woman-NOM that man's back + OBJ scratch-PAST He woman scratched the man's back' cA salam-Ii tIN-I kI yAca-eke kIlk-bi-Assta the man's back-NoM that woman-by scratch-PASS-PAST `That man's back was scratched by the woman' While the first sentence may mean that the woman scratched the man's back with or without him being willing, the second can only mean that the man let her scratch his back. In that sense he is in control of the action. However, notions of agency, control and animacy are conceptually closely linked, and it may be that all or any of them are often involve:p. 1385.7 Varieties of passive p.142Passive: related and problematic issues 6.1 Reflexives and indefinites as passives Many lgs have retlexive constructions, i.e. constructions in which the Object is indicated as being referentially identical with the Subject by means of a reflex ive pronoun. Examples are the English wash oneself, and the equivalent French se laver and Russian myt' s'a. ln a number of lgs the same construction is also used as a passive. In Russian, for instance, the passive is formed by using the copula (the verb `to be') with verbs in the perfective aspect, but by the reflexive fonn for verbs in the imperfective (SitWerska 1985: 247): p. 1456.2 Other passive-like constructions Many lgs use an indetinite `they' or `he' l'one' as a Subject to convey a meaning similar to that of an Agent-less passive. Thus in English `they say . . .' has roughly the same meaning as `It is said . . . `. Similarly, for Lakhota (N. America), Foley and Van Valin (198S: 334) quote: {\ldots}However, in some languages there are constructions that are very like these, but are treated as passive in that an obliquely-marked Agent may be added; examples from Kimbundu (Bantu, Givon 1979: 211) and Trukic (Micronesian, Jacobs 1976: 121) both quoted in Shimtani 1985: 845) are: Nzua a-mu-mono kwa marne .a :;me John they-him-saw by me `John was seen by me' Waan re-liila --`` ree- I John they-hirn-killed by-me `John was killed by me' },

  Abstract                 = {Indo-European verbs inflected in the middle voice have taken on passive meaning; explanations for this have been proposed, but each presents difficulties. Here an alter- native paradigm of language change is set forth to explain the process. This paradigm is, among other things, dependent on the fact that more than one structural description may be assigned to a given sentence. If the hearer assigns a different structural description to a sentence than the speaker does, and if a rule based on this 'deviant' structural description spreads, then the language exhibits change. Under certain circumstances, then, agentless OV constructions may be mis-assigned the constituent structure of a passive SV construction-where the object of the active, transitive sentence is interpreted as the subject of its passive, intransitive counterpart. },

  Abstract                 = {Is calculation possible without language? Or is the human ability for arithmetic dependent on the language faculty? To clarify the relation between language and arithmetic, we studied numerical cognition in speakers of Munduruku, an Amazonian language with a very small lexicon of number words. Although the Munduruku lack words for numbers beyond 5, they are able to compare and add large approximate numbers that are far beyond their naming range. However, they fail in exact arithmetic with numbers larger than 4 or 5. Our results imply a distinction between a nonverbal system of number approximation and a language-based counting system for exact number and arithmetic.},

  Abstract                 = {Native speakers of two languages (English and Ndonga) were compared on three colour cognition tasks (sorting, triads and visual search) in a test of the linguistic relativity hypothesis (Whorf, 1956). The colour lexicons of these two languages differ because Ndonga has no basic terms for ORANGE, PINK and PURPLE, and stimuli were chosen to exploit this difference. On the sorting task (sorting into similarity-groups) for each language, nominally similar colours were grouped together more often than nominally dissimilar colours. On the triads task (choosing the most different of three colours), when the most nominally isolated colour differed for the two language-groups, each group tended to choose their nominal isolate. On the search task (scanning for target colours among distractors), targets were either in a different English category than distractors (cross-category), or some distractors were in the same English category as distractors (within-category). The 'cost' in speed of having within-category distractors was much greater for the English than for the Ndonga. Overall, these data suggest that a core universal component is modulated by a small relativist influence. The differences in the visual search task are consistent with language affecting pre-attentive processes (an indirect language effect) as well as exerting on-line influences (a direct effect).},

  Abstract                 = {Age-old socio-anthropology By LAL RAPACHA When one deeply ponders the dynamics of redefining socio-anthropological identification of the Nepalese ethno-indigenous communities, s/he needs to be very critical and precautious about the trends of classification and literature available on them. Age-old or impressionistic rather than scientific notions of ethnological descriptions of those communities are customary amongst the native/foreign researchers and experts till today. One of such commonest instances is Professor Dor Bahadur Bista's ethnological descriptive efforts about the Nepalese communities in the 'People of Nepal', though magnum opus is often taken for granted by researchers and experts in the history of socio-anthropology of Nepal. Many critics and reviewers have had praised his academic achievement at such a time of its publication when no one could think of such present pluri-ethnic groups in the country. Although Prof Bista is credited as the founder-father of socio-anthropology in Nepal, his knowledge on the people of Nepal now has seriously been questioned in an International Conference organized by Sociological/Anthropological Society of Nepal (SASON) held on 11-13 December 2006 in Administrative Staff College , Lalitpur. The Conference's main theme was 'Social Sciences in a Multicultural World: Addressing the Persistence of Deprivation, Conflict and Violence' with several other sub-themes like 'Ethnicity', 'Perspectives on Conflict and Social Movements', 'Development Practices Observed', 'Political Transition, Democracy and Development', 'Gender', 'Cross Cutting Issues', Human Rights and Mental Health, 'Language and Culture', 'Resource Management', 'Perspectives on Agriculture and Development' and so forth. It was in the 'ethnicity' sub-theme where Prof Bista, T. Ukyab and S. Akhikari and Kir?tologist Iman S Chemjong were inquired and criticized bitterly for claiming the Kiranti-K?its (hydro-exonym: Sunuwar) as "offshoots of the Magars" and their Mother Tongue slightly differing from "the Magar dialect". Actually their claims were the replica of Queen's Gurkha Officers such as E. Vansittart, W. B. Northey and C.J. Morris's writings on the Kiranti-K?its/Sunuwar during the British colonial imperialism. Socio-anthropology scarcely smells in their observations. Another most serious criticism in the conference was on Toni Hagen's definition of the ethno-indigenous Sunuwar people of Wallo Kirat, eastern Nepal "as excellent smiths and goldsmiths". Dr Hagen, who introduced Nepal with his work 'Nepal: A Kingdom in the Himalayas' has described them with such unscientific and inaccurate description on page 123 of the English version published in 1980 by IBH Publishing Co. The same faulty Hagen-notion has been imitated and reiterated by the native scholars like JP Ananda, RR Subedi et al, K Parajuli et al, MR Acharya, S Prapannacharya, Dr DP Aryal and Nanda R Shrestha/Keshav Bhattarai blindly in their voluminous works with out any rectifications or justifications. This scholarly copycat-trend has shown that socio-anthropology as the science of society the mankind seems to be worn out and needs to be revised in the true spirit of empirical science in present-day Nepal's context. Socio-anthropology in Nepal facing much more criticisms these days is the classification and recognition of till unknown ethnic groups by National Foundation for Development of Nationalities (NFDIN) since sociologists/anthropologists are involved in the process exclusive of linguists. The recognition of Kiranti-Surel as a separate ethno-indigenous group having no separate language other than the dialect of Kiranti-K?its of its own has posed problems in the defining criteria of the term 'nationalities' whereas the Kiranti-Bakulochana (Banatawa, Bayung, Kulung, Lohorung, Chamling, Nachhiring and Yamphu) Movement has been voicing for a separate identity-recognition based on the criteria of their unique languages and cultural practices. Simply one Chepang ethnic group's division into three groups such as Praja, Chepang and Bankariya seems nothing more than ethno-politicization since the term Praja as an ethnic group was coined by King Mahendra's Model of Democracy. Bankariya is a recent phenomenon as is Surel. Furthermore, Dewans are also claiming as separate ethnic group either from Kirat- Yakkha or Kirat-Yakthung in eastern Nepal. The same problem of classification and recognition of some major tribes in the western hills of the country has remained as nationalities' riddles and even experts of sociology and anthropology are not exactly getting through it. The practice of socio-anthropology in Nepal at Tribhuvan University (TU) for more than four decades now is nothing more than cramming the definitions and explanations of 'society' and 'humans with certain sets of behaviors/features' provided by the Western scholars and Xeroxed in Nepal. There exists no laboratory for genome/DNA sampling observations and comparative analysis of anthropology as science. Anthropological linguistics as one of the most essential modules in socio-anthropological studies has not yet been introduced in the Masters course as inseparable component of Sociology/Anthropology in the University. As a result, most TU-products majoring Socio-anthropology are not easily motivated towards the innovative research in anthropology although it is very useful and relevant discipline for Nepal. Its main impacts are visible as darkness in the case of ethno-politicization among ethno-indigenous peoples of Nepal mocking science as puppet in the hand of crooked politicians if not politics. Doing innovative research is indispensable in order to understand and solve the riddles of nationalities' identification and recognition for their inclusive participation in political spheres demanded by the Federation of Nationalities. It should firstly be started with restructured and renovated paleontological ideas rather than from age-old socio-anthropological practice of Nepal. This makes SASON's international conference meaningful or socio-anthropology worth-practicing epistemologically as empirical science for the sake of human society free from deprivation, conflict and violence.

  Abstract                 = {It is widely held that named color categories in the world's languages are organized around universal focal colors and that these focal colors tend to be chosen as the best examples of color terms across languages. However, this notion has been supported primarily by data from languages of industrialized societies. In contrast, recent research on a language from a nonindustrialized society has called this idea into question. We examine color-naming data from languages of 110 nonindustrialized societies and show that (i) best-example choices for color terms in these languages cluster near the prototypes for English white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue, and (ii) best-example choices cluster more tightly across languages than do the centers of category extensions, suggesting that universal best examples (foci) may be the source of universal tendencies in color naming.},

  Abstract                 = {English and Russian color terms divide the color spectrum differently. Unlike English, Russian makes an obligatory distinction between lighter blues ("goluboy") and darker blues ("siniy"). We investigated whether this linguistic difference leads to differences in color discrimination. We tested English and Russian speakers in a speeded color discrimination task using blue stimuli that spanned the siniy/goluboy border. We found that Russian speakers were faster to discriminate two colors when they fell into different linguistic categories in Russian (one siniy and the other goluboy) than when they were from the same linguistic category (both siniy or both goluboy). Moreover, this category advantage was eliminated by a verbal, but not a spatial, dual task. These effects were stronger for difficult discriminations (i.e., when the colors were perceptually close) than for easy discriminations (i.e., when the colors were further apart). English speakers tested on the identical stimuli did not show a category advantage in any of the conditions. These results demonstrate that (i) categories in language affect performance on simple perceptual color tasks and (ii) the effect of language is online (and can be disrupted by verbal interference).},
